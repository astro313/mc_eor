\begin{abstract}
We study the properties of molecular cloud (MC) complexes in a prototypical galaxy (``Alth{\ae}a'') at redshift $z\approx 6$ using cosmological zoom-in simulations.
%
We identify MCs using an H$_2$ density-based clump finder, and compare their mass, size, velocity dispersion, gas surface density, and virial parameter ($\alpha_{\rm vir}$) with those observed in nearby and \z$\lesssim 2$ galaxies.
%
In \flower, MCs masses are in the range $10^{5.5-8.5}$\,\Msun, and have sizes $R\lesssim200$\,pc. Their velocity dispersion and gas surface density are systematically higher than those observed in nearby galaxies, but comparable to starburst galaxies.
%
We identify gravitationally unstable MCs both via an effective, two-component Toomre $Q_{\rm eff}$ parameter (gas+stars), and using a more observationally accessible $\alpha_{\rm vir}$ analysis. We find that MCs in the main disk of \flower are globally stable, but their internal substructures have low $\alpha_{\rm vir}$ and $Q_{\rm eff}$ values, indicative of collapse.
%
%Our results suggest that the more massive and bigger MCs compared to the Milky Way manifest from the
%higher gas mass fraction, surface density, and velocity dispersion.

\section{Introduction}
\DL{please igonre Fig 7 for now. Labels/markers in the AlphaVir plots in Fig 5,6 will be updated based on Jens Kauffman's comments} 
The growth of galaxies and their subsequent evolution are governed by the baryon cycle --- galaxies accrete gas from the intergalactic medium (IGM) to fuel \SF (and feed their supermassive black holes). Subsequent feedback replenishes and enriches the circumgalactic medium with part of this material. The general consensus is that the growth of \highz galaxies are triggered and supported by massive gas inflows from mergers and/or cosmic web at early cosmic times. Back then, galaxies themselves are more gas-rich and their molecular fraction possibly higher compared to present-day galaxies.

Such massive gas inflows trigger gravitational instabilities which lead to the formation of molecular complexes that are typically more massive ($M_{\rm cl}\approx 10^9$\,\Msun) and extended ($\approx$ sub-kpc) than those observed in nearby galaxies (e.g., \citealt{Gabor13a, Hopkins14a, Inoue16a}).
%
Some theoretical works argue that the migration of such giant massive clumps are largely responsible for the buildup of the bulges of massive galaxies at \z$\sim$\,0 \citep[e.g.,][]{Ceverino10a}.

Given that \highz galaxies statistically represent  the early evolutionary stages of present-day galaxies, studying their ISM properties is essential for understanding how \SF proceeds under more extreme conditions. Current consensus is that early galaxies have higher star formation rates \citep[SFR; ][]{Behroozi13b, Sparre15a, Maiolino15a, Dunlop17a} and smaller sizes \citep[e.g.,][]{Bouwens11a, Ono13a} compared to the local population.
%
As a consequence, we expect them to be significantly more ionized, and have intense and hard interstelar radiation fields (ISRF). Since their metallicity and dust content are also expected to be lower in these early evolutionary stages, shielding of UV photons - responsible for the photoheating of the gas - is strongly reduced. Such differences in turn affect the regulation of the multi-phase ISM thermal and chemical state.

Even in the local Universe, where detailed \obs can be attained, variations in cloud properties have been observed between different galaxy populations (see e.g., \citealt{Hughes10a, Hughes13b}). It is thus intuitive and reasonable to pose the question: {\it what are the physical properties of MCs in early galaxies, and how do they differ from those found in local \galpop?}
%

FIR fine-structure lines (e.g., \cii, \nii, and \oiii), and CO and [\ci]~lines are key diagnostics for constraining the ISM conditions of galaxies. They also provide highly complementary information on different ISM phases (ionized, atomic, molecular; e.g., \citealt{Scoville74a, Rubin85a, Malhotra01a}).
%
Global measurements of these diagnostics in \highz galaxies have provided preliminary information on their global properties (e.g., gas masses, gas temperature, and radiation field intensity). However, spatially resolving their ISM is necessary to fully understand many aspects of galaxy evolution and the physics behind their intense \SF (SFR\ssim100$-$3000\,\Msun\,yr\pmOne).
%
To date, spatially resolved ISM properties of \highz galaxies have only been mapped in a handful of (strongly-lensed) galaxies at intermediate-$z$, using tracers such as dust continuum, CO, and \cii lines (e.g., \citealt{Swinbank11a, Hodge15a, Ferkinhoff15a, Hodge16a, Leung19a}). These studies find that galaxies close to the peak of cosmic \SF ($z$\ssim2), are more molecular gas-rich, turbulent, and clumpy than nearby galaxies.

Earlier epochs still represent an essentially uncharted territory for ISM investigations. At present, it remains unclear how \SF proceeds in the (sub-)$L^*$ galaxy population at \z$\gtrsim$\,6  which is responsible for producing the bulk of the UV photons that reionized the Universe.
%
While ALMA has enabled the detection of \cii158\,$\micron$ and CO line emission in normal (SFR$<$\,100\,\Msun\,yr\pmOne) galaxies at \z$>$\,6 over the past few years \citep[e.g.,][]{Carniani18b, Odorico18a}, the first spatially resolved observations are just starting to become available \citep{Smit18a,Jones17a}. 

To answer these questions, isolate key issues, and  accompany ongoing/future experimental efforts, we have undertaken a detailed numerical study whose aim is to characterize the dynamical properties of the star-forming molecular cloud complexes in prototypical (i.e., $L^*$) galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). 

The paper is structured as follows\footnote{Throughout this paper, we adopt a concordance cosmology, with total matter, vacuum and baryonic densities in units of the critical density $\Omega_{\Lambda}$\eq0.692, $\Omega_m$\eq0.308, $\Omega_b$\eq0.0481, Hubble constant $H_0$\eq100\,$h$\,km s\pmOne\,Mpc\pmOne with $h$\eq0.678, spectral index $n$\eq0.967 and $\sigma_8$\eq0.826 \citep{Planck14a}.}. We start by providing some physical background in \Sec{Back}. In \Sec{sim}, we describe the setup of our simulation and properties of our main galaxy (\flower). In \Sec{eqn}, we describe the method used to identify molecular gas complexes and present the formalism within which we interpret the results. In \Sec{results}, we present the results and the scaling relations for the MCs. We then interpret the results and discuss the implications of our findings in \Sec{diss}, and give our conclusions in \Sec{conclusion}.
%
\section{Physical Background}\label{sec:Back}
We begin by introducing some basic material concerning known physical relations and stability analysis of MCs that will become useful in the following.
\subsection{Larson relations}\label{sec:PVE}
\citep{Larson81a} discussed a number of relations among Galactic MC properties, namely the linewidth-size, density-size, and mass-size relations. Larson relations are routinely used for comparing properties of molecular structures in different galactic environments. They also represent a useful framework to analyze our results as they arise from the interplay between gravity and turbulence encoded in the virial theorem. 

In general, the virial theorem for a gas distribution of gas can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:virial_th_general}
\frac{1}{2}\ddot{\mathcal{I}} = 2(\mathcal{T} - \mathcal{T}_{\rm ext}) + \mathcal{W},
\end{equation}
where $\ddot{\mathcal{I}}$ is the second time derivative of the Lagrangian moment of inertia, $\mathcal{T}$ is the internal energy of the gas, $\mathcal{T}_{\rm ext}$ is external pressure support, and $\mathcal{W}$ is the gravitational energy.
%
Let us specialize to the case of a spherical self-gravitating molecular cloud of mass $M_{\rm cl}$, radius $R$, and r.m.s. velocity dispersion $\sigma$, accounting for both thermal and turbulent contributions. Neglecting magnetic field and defining $P_{\rm ext}$ the external pressure, \Eq{virial_th_general} can be written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}{\ddot{\mathcal{I}}} = 3 M_{\rm cl} \sigma^2 - 4\pi P_{\rm ext} R^3 - \Gamma\frac{GM_{\rm cl}^2}{R}\,,
\label{eqn:virial}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ is a geometrical factor that is equal to 3/5 for a uniform sphere; in \Eq{virial} the terms on the r.h.s. represent the kinetic, external, and gravity pressure terms. 
%
For the case of simple virial equilibrium (SVE; i.e., equilibrium state without external pressure), \Eq{virial} becomes:
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{\rm vir} \equiv \frac{3\sigma^2}{\Gamma (GM_{\rm cl}/R)} = \frac{5\sigma^2R}{GM_{\rm cl}}\,,
\label{eqn:alpha}
\end{equation}
which defined as the virial parameter $\alpha_{\rm vir}$.

Motivated by the Larson's linewidth-size relation \citep{Larson81a} and the work by \citet{Heyer09a}, we recast Equation~\ref{eqn:alpha} into 
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2/R = \pi G \Sigma/5\,,
\label{eqn:SVE}
\end{equation}
for gas in virial equilibrium, i.e., by setting $\alpha_{\rm vir}$\eq1; the surface density $\Sigma$\eq$M/\pi R^2$. On the other hand, for pressure-bounded virial equilibrium (PVE; i.e. equilibrium state with external pressure), Equation~\ref{eqn:virial} becomes:
\begin{equation}
P_{\rm ext} = \frac{3\sigma^2M_{\rm cl}}{4\pi R^3} - \Gamma\frac{G M_{\rm cl}^2}{4\pi R^4}\,,
\label{eqn:pext}
\end{equation}
which quantifies the external pressure needed to confine the gas inside a given volume. Substituting again $\Sigma$  into Equation~\ref{eqn:pext}, we find 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sigma^2}{R} = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{4P_{\rm ext}}{\Sigma} + \Gamma G \Sigma \pi \right)\,,
\label{eqn:v0}
\end{equation}
keeping $\sigma^2/R$ on the LHS.

Based on Equations~\ref{eqn:SVE} and \ref{eqn:pext}, a one-to-one mapping between $\sigma^2/R$ and $\Sigma$ is therefore expected for a virialized cloud, since $\sigma^2/R\propto\Sigma$. Equation~\ref{eqn:v0} then yields the loci along which external pressures $P_{\rm ext}$ are needed in order for some given MCs to have linewidths $\sigma$ for a given set of surface densities. In other words, a cloud with $\sigma$ and $\Sigma$ offset from $\sigma^2/R\mapsto\Sigma$ is in equilibrium with external pressure $P_{\rm ext}$; therefore $\sigma^2/R$ is not constant with $\Sigma$ but varies depending on $P_{\rm ext}$ (cf. expectation for SVE, where $\sigma\propto R^{0.5}$; see e.g., \citealt{Heyer09a, Hughes10a, Hughes13b, Meidt13a}).

Summarizing, the virial parameter can be used to quantify the stability/boundedness of an MC. Accounting for the external pressure, a virial parameter of $\alpha_{\rm vir}\lesssim2$ would be unstable \citep{bertoldi:1992}.
%
Such criterion is often used in \obs \citep[see e.g., ][]{Kauffmann17b}; in the following, to facilitate comparison with \obs, we derive $\alpha_{\rm vir}$ using the gas component only and ignore contributions due to the stellar component.

%\subsection{Gravitational Instabilities}\label{sec:Q}
\subsection{Toomre stability analysis}\label{sec:Q}

The onset of gravitational instability is considered to be tightly connected to \SF \citep[e.g.,][]{Kennicutt89a, Wang94a, Li05b, Li06a}. From virial theorem, Jeans instability sets the scales at which gravitational potential overcomes the internal energy. Namely, gravitational instabilities dominates at scales $L > L_J$, where $L_J$ is the Jeans length. However, centrifugal force resulting from differential rotation in disk galaxies can inhibit collapse even on these scales. As a result, a disk is thought to be unstable on scales between $L_J < L < L_{\rm rot}$, where $L_{\rm rot}$ is set by the surface density of the disk and the angular velocity of the rotation.

In theoretical and observational works, gravitational instability has been widely discussed in the context of the Toomre $Q$ stability criterion \citep{Toomre64a, Goldreich65b} or its observable proxy  $v_{\rm circ}/\sigma$, i.e., the circular velocity to dispersion ratio \citep[e.g.,][]{GarciaBurillo03a, Genzel11a, Kassin12a, Leung19a}.

%
% from linear analysis
For {\it axisymmetric} mode, the dispersion relation for the growth of density perturbation in a rotating turbulent disk of finite thickness $h$ is described by
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = \kappa^2 - \frac{2\pi G \Sigma |k|}{1 + |k| h} + \sigma^2 k^2\,,
\label{eqn:3Ddisp}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the wavenumber and $\kappa$ is the epicyclic frequency, defined as:
\begin{equation}
\kappa^2\equiv\frac{2\Omega}{R}\frac{d}{dR}\left(R^2\Omega\right)\,.
\label{eqn:kappa}
\end{equation}
\citep{Romeo92a}.
The first term on the RHS of Equation~\ref{eqn:3Ddisp} describes rotation support, whereas the second term describes self-gravity, and the third term describes internal pressure support. The Toomre $Q$ parameter for the gas component can be defined as \citep{Toomre64a}:
\begin{equation}
Q_{\rm gas}\equiv\frac{\sigma_{\rm gas}\kappa}{\pi G \Sigma_{\rm gas}}\,.
\label{eqn:Q}
\end{equation}
In the thin disk approximation ($kh\ll1$), the solution of \Eq{3Ddisp} is unstable for scales $k$ such that $Q < Q_{\rm crit}\simeq1$ (or equivalently $\omega^2 < 0$). Physically, this situation occurs when local gravitational instability
overcomes support from pressure and rotation, allowing fragmentation and collapse to happen. Similarly, for a collisionless fluid --- as an ensemble of stars --- the Toomre $Q$ parameter is defined by \citep{Toomre64a}:
\begin{equation}
Q_{\star} \equiv\frac{\sigma_{\star}\kappa}{3.36 G \Sigma_{\star}}\,.
\end{equation}

In our stability analysis, we account for the non-negligible disk thickness and for the combined effect of gas and stars; this is done adopting the approximation for an effective two-component $Q_{\rm eff}$ parameter \citep[i.e.,][see also \citealt{Inoue16a}]{Romeo11a}.
%
The effect of disk thickness modify the $Q$ parameter for gas/star by accounting for the vertical velocity dispersion:
\begin{equation}
T_{x} = \left\{
		\begin{array}{lccr}
			{\displaystyle 0.8 + 0.7\left(\frac{\sigma_{z}}{\sigma_{r}}\right)}      && & \mbox{if\ } \sigma_z \lesssim 0.5 \times \sigma_r \\ [1.25em]
			{\displaystyle 1 + 0.6\left(\frac{\sigma_{z}}{\sigma_{r}}\right)}        & & & \mbox{if\ } \sigma_z \gtrsim 0.5 \times \sigma_r
\\
		\end{array}
	\right.
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
Q^{\rm thick}_{x} = T_{x} Q\,,
\end{equation}
with $x$ indicating either gas or stars.
% Note that w/ thickness, there's the a self-gravity dilution term in the dispersion relation, which in effect reduceds the surface gravity in the vertical direction. As such, it is easier to be stable against gravitaional instability. Thus, the criterion for instability $Q$ is reduced.
%
The combined effect of gas and stars can then be accounted for by writing
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:q_eff}
Q^{-1}_{\rm eff} =  \left\{
				\begin{array}{lccr}
					     {\displaystyle\frac{w}{Q^{\rm thick}_{\star}} + \frac{1}{Q^{\rm thick}_{\rm gas}}}      & & & \mbox{if\ }  Q^{\rm thick}_{\star} \geq Q^{\rm thick}_{\rm gas} \\ [0.75em]
                                               {\displaystyle\frac{1}{Q^{\rm thick}_{\star}} + \frac{w}{Q^{\rm thick}_{\rm gas}}}      & & & \mbox{if\ } Q^{\rm thick}_{\star} \leq Q^{\rm thick}_{\rm gas} \\
				\end{array}
			    \right.
\end{equation}
where the relative weight $w$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
w\equiv\frac{2 \sigma_{\star} \sigma_{\rm gas}}{\sigma_{\star}^2 + \sigma_{\rm gas}^2},
\end{equation}
Conceptually, the thickness of a disk reduces the gravity in the vertical direction, thereby making it easier for a system to obtain stability, and thus lowering the criterion of the critical Toomre $Q_{\rm crit}$ from $\simeq$\,1 to 
0.67 \citep{Goldreich65a}.
%
On the other hand, including the contribution of the stellar component promotes gravitational instability, and thus, increasing the criterion of the Toomre $Q_{\rm crit}$, unless it is dynamically hot to ``compensate''. As a rule of thumb, $Q_{\rm crit}\eq1.34$ for $Q_{\rm gas}$\eq$Q_\star$.  % 0.67 * 2

\section{Numerical simulations}\label{sec:sim}
The simulations used in this work are described by \citealt{Pallottini17a, Pallottini17b} and are only briefly summarized here.
%
\ncode{Serra}\footnote{Greenhouse in italian} is a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations performed using Eulerian hydrodynamics and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique to achieve high spatial resolution in the region of interest (i.e., regions of high density).
%
In particular, it uses a modified version of \ncode{ramses} \citep{Teyssier02a} as the AMR backend. The simulation used here covers a comoving box of 20\,Mpc $h$\pmOne in size, resolving down to a physical scale of $l\approx$\,30\,pc (at $z\sim6$) and a (baryonic) mass resolution of $m_b\simeq$\,10$^4$\,\Msun at the finest level. Such a physical scales are comparable to those of local giant molecular clouds \citep[e.g.,][]{Sanders85a, Federrath13a, Goodman14a}.

We include a chemical network including ${\rm e}, \rm{H}$, $\rm{H}^{+}$, $\rm{H}^{-}$, $\rm{He}$, $\rm{He}^{+}$, $\rm{He}^{++}$, $\rm{H}_2$, $\rm{H}_2^{+}$ \citep{Grassi14a,Bovino16a}. Of particular importance here is that abundances are calculated using a on-the-fly non-equilibrium formation of molecular hydrogen scheme following \citet{Pallottini17b}.

% radiative feedback --> NT pressure
Star formation is modeled using a H$_2$-based prescription of the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation \citep{Krumholz09a}. We adopt stellar tracks from \ncode{starburst99} and include stellar feedback from supernovae (SN) and OB/AGB stars. Coupling to the gas is implemented via a sub-grid model for blastwaves, which accounts for radiative energy losses inside the cell. The remaining energy is injected into the ISM in kinetic and thermal energy forms. Radiation pressure on dust and gas is also included (see \citealt{Pallottini17a} for details).

The simulation zooms on a galaxy named \flower whose properties are given in \citet{Pallottini17b} and are briefly summarized in the following. \flower is a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG), that at $z\simeq 6$ is hosted by a dark matter halo of mass $M_{\rm DM}\simeq$\,10$^{11}$\,\Msun at the center of a cosmic web knot, and accretes mass from the IGM mainly via three filaments of length $\simeq$\,100\,kpc; \flower has a stellar mass of $M_\star\simeq$\,3\E{10}\,\Msun, a metallicity of $Z\simeq$\,0.5\,$Z_{\odot}$, a molecular gas mass of $M_{\rm H2}\simeq$\,5\E{7}\,\Msun, and a SFR of $\simeq$\,100\,\Msun\,yr\pmOne. Its effective stellar radius  is $\sim$0.5\,kpc and the dark matter virial radius is $r_{\rm 200}\simeq$\,15\,kpc.

\subsection{Star Formation History} \label{sec:sfh}

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[trim=0 0 0 0, clip, width=0.65\textwidth]{\figpath/sfh.pdf}
\caption{
    {\it Top panel}: Star formation history of \flower. {\it Bottom}: projected stellar mass distribution during {\it (a)} an early accretion phase;  {\it (b)} a major starburst following a merger event; and {\it (c)} a relatively quiescent post-starburst phase.
\label{fig:SFH}}
\end{figure*}

One of the main advantages for studying the dynamical properties of simulated galaies is the fact that we can examine how their properties evolve with time.
%
%This is advantageous especially at early cosmic epochs, when the densest structures are beginning to form; gas is constantly being accreted onto the central galaxy from the cosmic web and satellite galaxies, thereby leading to bursts of \SF. Meanwhile, tidal forces resulting from interactions with these surrounding galaxies can disrupt the main disk and arms, likely leading to different dynamical states for the molecular structures compared to more evolved galaxies found at a later cosmic time (e.g., some molecular structures may disperse while others may agglomerate into more massive ones). % mainly expecting differences in alpha_vir, sigma, M_cl.

The \SF history\footnote{Note that here the SFR is calculated based on the stellar mass formed in the last 10 Myr within 3.5 kpc from the galaxy center of mass. The SFR plotted in Figure 2 of \citet{Pallottini17b} is a factor of two higher since there the SFR account for the contribution from massive satellite galaxies within the virial radius ($\approx$15\,kpc).} of \flower is shown in \Fig{SFH}. The SFR of \flower varies between $\sim$30$-$80\,\Msun\,yr\pmOne as it evolves from an actively accreting phase to a starburst phase after a merger, and then back to a relatively quiescent phase, over the simulated $\approx 700$ Myr.

Given \flower's SF stochastic nature, in this work we mostly focus on the analysis of two of its most extreme evolutionary stages (see \Sec{singless}). The two phases correspond to (a) intense accretion (b) starburst (\Fig{SFH}). We are interesting in determining whether MC properties are sensitive to these different dynamical conditions. For completeness, for the other evolutionary stages traced in the simulation we only show scaling relations (see \Fig{alpha16-28}).

Throughout this paper, we dub as ``satellite galaxies'' the dense gas regions outside the main disk of \flower. The distinction between clumps and satellites is admittedly somewhat ambiguous, and we consider it only as a working one.
\AF{To be discussed at the end}

\section{Molecular Cloud Complexes}\label{sec:eqn}

\subsection{Identification}\label{sec:method}

To identify the molecular complexes, we use a customized version of the ``clump-finding'' algorithm available in the \ncode{python} package \ncode{yt} \citep{Turk11a}, which was initially described in \citet{Smith09a}, but this function has been modified since then.
%
The latest version of the default \ncode{yt} clump finder decomposes the zones of the simulation into non-overlapping tiles, which are stored in a $k$-dimensional tree ($k$-D tree). It then identifies the contours of a variable field (here, the density field) within a tile and connects them across the tiles. In the customized version used for this study, we modify the function to enhance the stability of the code.
%
Due to the nature of our AMR simulation, we regrid the simulation data into uniform grids. The grid size is defined based on the highest resolution of the simulation data, i.e., the less refined regions are supersampled in the resulting uniform grids.

In the clump-finding process, we employ a set of different density thresholds defined based on the molecular hydrogen density of \flower at different evolutionary stages ($z$\eq6.0\,$-$\,7.2).
%
We note that this process is in essence similar to identifying molecular structures based on the noise levels of surface density maps observers obtain with telescopes, using molecular line tracers such as CO, CS, and HCN, as commonly adopted in observational studies (e.g., identifying clumps based on/after applying S/N-clipping, using tools such as \ncode{aips}'s task \ncode{serch}, \ncode{clumpfind}, and \ncode{cprops}; \citealt{Williams94a, Oka01a, Rosolowsky06a, Rosolowsky08a}).
%
We note that, owing to the nature of \obs, such structures are identified in position-position-velocity (PPV) space, whereas in simulations, one has the full 6D spatial-kinematic information, and can therefore cleanly identify structures directly using the density field in position-position-position (PPP) space.
% Many concerning the correspondence between  ... , dating back to the work by \citep{Adler92a}.
Existing studies find a good correspondence in the dynamical properties extracted in PPV- versus PPP-space (\citealt{Ballesteros-Paredes02a, Heitsch09a, Shetty10a, Beaumont13a, Pan15a}, but see also \citealt{Shetty10a} for a discussion on caveats and limitations).
% large scale structure in PPP may be identified as numerous lower mass structures in the PPV cube due to gradients in the LOS and conversly, superposition when spatially distinct components with the same velocity are "merged" into one component in the PPV space when observed along the LOS (see Fig. 1 of Beaumount13a). (may be worth putting more thoughts on this after the report is due).

\end{figure*}

In \Fig{h2density}, we show the H$_2$ number density ($n_{\rm H2}$) distribution of \flower~in its accreting phase, by including the contribution from the gas within 3.5 kpc from the galaxy center.
%
We note that the distribution is almost flat for $n_{\rm H2}\gtrsim1$\,\cc and it samples the range of densities where clumps are found based on morphological analysis\footnote{For $n_{\rm H2}\gtrsim1$\,\cc the fourth Minkowsky functional of the H$_{2}$ density field is significantly larger than zero. This implies that the field is made of isolated components. See Fig. 6 in \citet{Pallottini17b}.} \citep{Pallottini17b}. We identify MCs by applying 10 equally-spaced volumetric H$_2$ density cuts of ${(n_{\rm cut}/{\rm cm^{-3})}}\eq[0.32, 0.53, 0.88, 1.45, 2.45, 4.08, 5.81, 11.36, 18.96, 31.62]$\footnote{We also tested variations in $n_{\rm cut}$ range and found no qualitative differences (see \Sec{ncut}).} to each snapshot.

To visually appreciate  the clump finding procedure, in \Fig{MC} we overplot the molecular structures identified using a subset of the H$_2$ density cuts ($n_{\rm cut}$\eq0.53, 5.81, and 18.96\,\cc) on the H$_2$ density maps.
Since the molecular structures identified could easily appear as overlapping structures depending on the viewing angle, we also plot them in different three-dimensional projections (right panels of \Fig{MC}) so that one can more easily see that they are collections of disjoint structures.
%
We repeat this identification process for 14 evolutionary stages between redshift \z$\in$[6.0, 7.2], spaced by $\Delta t$\eq50\,Myr.

Note that we impose the additional constraint that an identified structure must be composed of at least 10 cells. We caution that an important caveat of such constraint is that we can only examine the parameter space of ``cloud'' of typical size $R\gtrsim 60$\,pc, because of the resolution limit in the simulation.

\subsection{Properties of the Clouds}

% Molecular clouds are the natal place for \SF, their structure and dynamics hold important clues to understanding
% the mechanisms and physics of formation and evolution of molecular structures and \SF.
Upon identifying the molecular structures, we extract properties such as the gas mass ($M_{\rm cl}$), effective size ($R$), Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$), r.m.s. velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), and gas surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm gas}$) to examine their dynamics.

The mass of an MC is calculated from the uniformly-gridded 3D density field, integrating over the MC volume $V$. The effective size is defined assuming spherical geometry, i.e. $R \equiv (3 V /4 \pi)^{1/3}$.
%
The velocity dispersion of MCs is calculated from non-thermal velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm NT}$) and thermal sound speed ($c_s$):
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2 = \sigma_{\rm NT}^2 + c_s^2.
\label{eqn:veldisp}
\end{equation}
%
In \obs of MC, the linewidths contribution of dense gas contribution is larger then the one from the diffuse gas. We therefore calculate each term on the RHS of Equation~\ref{eqn:veldisp} as a density-weighted quantity. For instance, the non-thermal velocity dispersion is calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\rm NT}^2 = \frac{1}{{3}}\frac{\sum_{i} \rho_i \left|\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{\bar v}\right|^2}{\sum_i \rho_i}\,,
\end{equation}
where the sum is done for the cells composing each MC.
%
The local sound speed of all identified molecular complexes is much smaller than their turbulent velocities\footnote{Velocity dispersions calculated from velocity field are comparable to those calculated from the pressure field, indicating that contribution from shear is unlikely to dominating the velocity dispersions reported here.\label{ftn:veldisp}}. On average, the Mach number of the MCs is  $\mathcal{M} = \sigma_{\rm NT}/c_s\approx 50$. This is consistent with the global analysis done on \flower by \citet{Vallini18a}.

We show in \Fig{dist} the MC distribution in terms of their molecular gas mass, radius, and gas mass fraction, which we define as
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm gas} = \frac{M_{\rm cl}} {\left(M_{\rm cl} + M_\star\right)},
\end{equation}
where $M_\star$ is the stellar mass within the MC volume.
%
We note that the distributions vary for different evolutionary stages of \flower. The highest density threshold of $n_{\rm cut}$\eq31.62\,\cc yields a minimum MC mass of the order of 10$^{5.5}$\,\Msun for the densest MC.
%
We find $\sim$10$-$13 MCs with masses exceeding 10$^8$\,\Msun across all the evolutionary stages considered in this work, for each  $n_{\rm cut}$ value. \AF{This is true only for low $n_{cut}$? Why in Fig. do you show the valu 18.96 instead?} \DL{MCs w/ Mcl $>$10$^8$\,\Msun is the case for each ncut.} Such massive clouds correspond to the galaxy molecular disk, that is identified as a single component for low $n_{\rm cut}$. The mass of the MCs identified ranges between $M_{\rm cl}\approx$10$^{5.5-8.5}$\,\Msun, consistent with those observed in \z$\sim$2 galaxies in rest-frame UV and optical light \citep{Elmegreen07a, Elmegreen09a}. \AF{you do not comment on $R$ and $f_{gas}$ here..Also, what is the total number of MCs?}

\subsection{Single Evolutionary Stage}  \label{sec:singless}

For each of the two most extreme evolutionary stages of \flower\ --- accretion and starburst phase (see \Sec{sfh}), we identify a set of MCs. Scaling relations for the MCs identified in the accretion phase are shown in left panels of \Fig{larsons_single} and in the right panels for the starburst phase.
% 
Some MCs in the starburst phase have lower velocity dispersion, $\alpha_{\rm vir}$, and $\sigma^2/R$ (closer to loci with lower external pressure) compared to the accretion phase. \DL{Is this significant enough to say something physical? If so, not immediately clear to me what cause the differences.}
%
Regardless of the H$_2$ density cuts adopted, MCs in both phases are found to have consistently high turbulence and surface densities. They correspond to MCs at the center of the main disk of \flower and occupy the top right corner of the Larson's relation shown in \Fig{larsons_single}. As we increase the density threshold, some of the MCs within the main disk break into multiple sub-MCs. As such, we effectively identify a population of denser molecular structures (see \Fig{MC}).

% PVE
We also compare the MCs identified in our simulations to those observed in the Milky Way in the context of the $\sigma^2/R - \Sigma$ relation (see bottom panels of \Fig{larsons_single}). Dashed lines in the figure show the loci along which the given external pressures are needed for MCs to have certain linewidths for a given set of surface densities (see \Sec{PVE}).
% (Rice+16) find variation in $V_0^2$, where they find larger linewidths for GMCs in inner galactic disk, but they find that the clouds in the Galactic disk are still consistent with SVE (see also Solomon87a ; cf. Heyer+09).
The MCs in the satellite galaxies are found to follow the locus of $\log{(P/\textrm{K cm}^{-3})}$\eq6, which
is consistent with that found for the bulk of dense gas in the simulation in the phase-space analysis presented in \citet{Pallottini17a}.

% cloud structures at large and small scale
% Larson's: m = 460 M_sun (r_pc)^1.9 for structure w/in molecular clouds. --> $m \propto r^2$ \citep{McKee07a} (law of constant
% column density) as fundamental properties of molecular cloud structure.
Larson's third relation relates MCs structures on small and large scales via two physical properties: mass and size \citep{Larson81a, McKee07a}. This is also known as the constant column density relation, since cloud mass in \obs is sometimes derived by integrating over the mass surface density, which is related to the column density ($N_H$) obtainable from extinction maps ($A_V$). By assuming dust properties from \citet[][]{weingartner:2001}, extinction for a cloud with MW-like dust can be written as 
\begin{equation}
A_v = \frac{N_H}{1.8 \times 10^{21} {\rm cm}^{-2}}\,,
\end{equation}
then, assuming spherical symmetry, the mass of a MC can be expressed as a function of $A_v$ and its size $R$
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:constantcolumndensity}
M_{\rm cl} = \frac{4\pi}{3} \mu m_p n R^3 = 154 \,A_v \left(\frac{R}{\rm pc}\right)^2 \Msun \,,
\end{equation}
where we have taken $\mu = 2.5$ as the mean molecular weight.

We show in \Fig{MR} the size-mass relation of the MCs of \flower compared to observational data of molecular clouds in the Milky Way that are found to be associated with massive \SF \citep{Beuther02a, Mueller02a, Hill05a, Motte07a} and an empirical relation obtained for massive \SF based on Milky Way clouds ($<$10\,\Msun; \citealt{Kauffmann10b, Kauffmann10c} and references therein): $M \gtrsim 870$\,\Msun$\times\,\left(r/{\rm pc}\right)^{1.33}$.
%
In the same plot, we also show loci of constant surface densities, which are parameterized through the visual extinction $A_V$. As shown in \Fig{MR}, the MCs identified in \flower lie above this relation, along the locus of $A_v \simeq 8.9$ clouds observed by \citet{Lombardi10a} in the MW.
%
%The values of $A_V$ inferred from http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.471.5018Fthe $M_{\rm cl}$-size relation is consistent with the extinction inferred from gas clumps analysing the UV and IR emission of \flower~by calculating the effect of radiative transfer through dust \citep[][in particular see Fig. 5 therein]{Behrens18a}

\subsection{Temporal Evolution and Adopted Density Threshold Dependence}\label{sec:ncut}
% single Snapshot
We investigate possible variations in the dynamics of the molecular structures of \flower and its satellites to test the robustness of our results against the choice of density threshold by adopting different sets of $n_{\rm cut}$ in identifying the MCs. That is, how sensitive are the structure properties, and thus, the results presented in \Sec{singless} dependent on the choice of density thresholds.
%
We vary the choice of H$_2$ density for each of the evolutionary stages and find no obvious differences in our results, i.e., inferences on the dynamics of \z$\sim$\,6 MCs in relation to those observed in nearby and \z$\sim$2 galaxies in the context of cloud scaling relations.
%
In addition, for the densest MC in the main disk of \flower, we find that while its size decreases as we increase $n_{\rm cut}$ --- as one would intuitively expect, the velocity dispersion remain approximately $\sigma\simeq$\,200\,\kms (see also \Fig{larsons_single}).
%
This lack of variation is reassuring, i.e. the dynamics of the MCs are not artifacts or biased by our choice of $n_{\rm cut}$ on the scales studied in the present work. Our results are therefore robust to the various density cuts of choice.

% temporal evolution in Cloud Dynamics
We show the properties of all MCs identified across all evolutionary stages in \Fig{alpha16-28}. We find no quantitative differences in the cloud properties over the 700\,Myr traced in our simulation.

\section{Discussions and Implications}\label{sec:diss}

\subsection{Placing Results in the Context of Existing Observations} \label{sec:diss1}

The MCs of \flower has dynamics largely similar to those observed in $z$\ssim2 spatially resolved studies of gas-rich star-forming galaxies, in terms of their velocity dispersions, sizes, and gas surface densities (\Fig{larsons_single}; see e.g., \citealt{Swinbank11a}), with sizes of the order of $R\simeq$\,100\,pc and velocity dispersions of $\sigma\simeq$\,20$-$80\,\kms.
%
% velocity dispersion, larsons
%
Their velocity dispersions are also comparable to those observed in the inner Milky way and nearby gas-rich galaxies (e.g., M64; \citealt{Oka01a, Rosolowsky05a, Heyer09a}), which lies along the locus of $\sigma\propto R^{0.56}$. Such high velocity dispersions and surface densities are expected since they are located in the nuclear regions of the galaxy, where the potential well is also deep. The higher velocity dispersions
(see footnote~\ref{ftn:veldisp} on page \pageref{ftn:veldisp}) of these MCs can also be understood as they have experienced more recent episodes of \SF as \flower is assembling its stellar mass (these MCs also have higher stellar-to-gas mass ratios of $\sim$60).
%
In fact, by the accretion stage (see \Fig{SFH}a) at $z\simeq$\,7.2, 
\flower has assembled a stellar mass of $M_\star$\eq7.5\E{9}\,\Msun. Thus, the higher velocity dispersion is due in part to the stronger stellar feedback compared to e.g., MCs in its satellites ($\sigma\approx$10\,\kms).


The high pressure observed in \flower is comparable to what has been observed in local ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs); however, the molecular clouds in the latter are concentrated within their central regions and have typical sizes of $\sim$70-100\,pc and masses on the order of $\sim$10$^9$\,\Msun \citep{Downes98a, Sakamoto08a}. In our simulated galaxy, the high pressure MCs of \flower are found throughout the disk. This difference likely stems from the different physical mechanisms giving rise to the formation (and thus the nature) of these molecular structures.
%
For instance, in local ULIRGs, they are likely form by shock compression and cloud-cloud collision after large amount of gas from the pair of progenitor galaxies are being funneled toward the central region \citep{Tan00a, Wu18a}.
% Tasker09a
On the other hand, the highly turbulent structures of \flower likely result from 
extra-planar flows that are due to gas accretion onto the galaxy and SN-driven outflows \citep{gallerani:2018,kohandel:2019}.
The presence of such extra-planar flows may also be the 
dominant mode for forming the highly supersonic massive MCs observed in gas-rich star-forming galaxies at $z$\ssim2 (see also e.g., \citealt{Swinbank11a}) --- but the observed size scales could also result from resolution limit where the true physical scales of MCs in $z$\,\ssim2 galaxies could be smaller in reality.
%
The constant inter-cloud collision as gas is being accreted onto the main galaxy would also render
the MCs to be gravitationally unbound (see e.g., \citealt{Dobbs11a}), which is
consistent with the high $\alpha_{\rm vir}$ found for the MCs in the main disk of \flower.

% mass-size relation
MCs of \flower lie below the locus of $A_V$\eq100\,mag followed by Milky Way clouds in the mass-size relation shown in \Fig{MR}. This can be understood by acknowledging the fact that a H$_2$ molecular cloud does not necessary contain CO (e.g., as CO forms deeper in molecular clouds), and that our simulation does not have enough resolution to directly form CO\footnote{In fact, to form CO and make predictions for CO line emission in the work presented by \citet{Vallini18a}, we model the internal structure of MC within each cell in our simulation.}.
%
That is, the MCs of \flower lying along the locus of $A_V$\eq4\,mag likely manifests from the fact that the MCs in our simulation have lower column densities than the star-forming cores observed in the Milky Way, which are observationally well-resolved within an MC, and indeed, have sufficient column density to form CO.

The \citet{Kauffmann10c} relation suggests that regions with high-mass \SF follow 
an ``internal'' mass-size relation where $M\propto r^{1.33}$.
If this holds for MCs of \flower, an extrapolation of the \citet{Kauffmann10c} relation down to $\sim$1\,pc would correspond to structures with masses and sizes comparable to those of the cores found in
regions of high-mass \SF. That is, the MCs identified have mass-size relations suggesting they are capable of high-mass \SF. 

% different evolutionary stages
In the scaling relations examined, we find similar MC properties in relation to those observed in the nearby Universe between the accretion phase and the starburst phase of \flower (see \Fig{larsons_single}). That is, we do not find any quantitative major differences in the MC properties between the accretion and the starburst phase, which are separated by $\simeq$300\,Myr. \DL{some MCs in SB phase have
lower $\alpha_{\rm vir}$ and pressure, but 
is there any significance in that?}

\subsection{Origin and Physical Scales of MCs} \label{sec:origin}

The largest molecular structure identified is essentially the main disk of \flower and breaks down into smaller substructures that are denser as we increase $n_{\rm cut}$ (see e.g., \Fig{alpha16-28}). Overall, the MCs we identified are much bigger in size and mass than nearby GMCs, but comparable to those observed in $z$\,\ssim2$-$4 galaxies based on spatially resolved imaging \citep{Swinbank11a}.

% mass scale
Observations of nearby gas-rich galaxies such as M64 and NGC\,253 show higher velocity dispersions compared to the disk/mid-plane of the Milky Way but consistent with those observed in the inner regions of Milky Way and M51 \citep{Oka01a, Rosolowsky05a, Heyer09a, Hughes13b, Leroy15a, Rice16a}.  % also higher $P_{\rm int}$,
% which is $\propto\rho\sigma^2$
% M51: Colombo+14
However, clouds in nearby gas-rich galaxies are bigger in size (approximately an order of magnitude) and mass (approximately two orders of magnitude).
These bigger clouds have been interpreted as a result of their higher gas mass fractions, surface densities, and velocity dispersions,
since fragmentation occurs near the Jeans length $L_J\propto\sigma^2/\Sigma$ and
Jeans mass $M_J\propto\sigma^4/\Sigma$ for dispersion-supported structures.

Based on the scaling of $M_J$\eq$\sigma^4/(G^2\Sigma)$ for the Jeans mass, a
velocity dispersion of $\sigma\approx50$\,\kms and a
gas mass surface density of $\Sigma_{\rm gas}\approx450$\,\Msun\,pc$^{-2}$ yields
$M_J\sim$\,8\E{8}\,\Msun, which is in good agreement with the mass range found in the MCs identified (see \Fig{dist}).
%
Similarly massive molecular clouds have been reported in idealized closed-box isolated galaxy simulations done at higher resolution (e.g., a maximum
resolution of 3\,pc in the 48\,kpc box studied by \citealt{Behrendt16a}).
Note, however, that the IGM and merger and accretion histories are not properly modeled in such simulations since they adopt non-cosmological initial conditions. That said, this is reassuring --- our results are not far off in spite of the limited resolution ($l_{\rm cell}\approx$\,30\,pc).

%Note that regions of $Q\lesssim1$ is actually somewhat
%less than the number of MCs we have identified based on density threshold ---
%but this has something to do with the dependence on
%$n_{\rm cut}$. The number of MCs and regions of low $Q$ are comparable if we only look at
%MCs identified at the highest $n_{\rm cut}$.

% alpha parameters
As shown in \Fig{larsons_single},
the virial parameter of the sub-MCs is about $\alpha_{\rm vir}\gtrsim10$, which is considerably lower than their ``parent'' MCs found in the main disk of \flower ($\alpha_{\rm vir}\gtrsim100$).
%
For the MCs in the satellite galaxies, a lower virial parameter is found compared to the (sub-)MCs in the main disk of \flower, with $\alpha_{\rm vir}\approx$\,2.
Differences in their $\alpha_{\rm vir}$ most likely result from the weaker stellar feedback in the satellites as they have experienced less episodes of \SF compared to \flower (i.e., lower stellar-to-gas mass ratios of $\sim$0.1).

% pext
As shown in \Fig{larsons_single},
MCs in the main disk of \flower have higher pressure than the sub-MCs. The lower virial parameter and external pressure of the sub-MCs compared to their parent MCs are consistent with the notion that collapsing structures result from local gravitational instability within globally non-collapsing structures \citep[see e.g.,][]{Ballesteros-Paredes11a}, which are supported by turbulence and rotation on large scales.
%Based on the virial parameter, velocity dispersion, and pressure of the MC identified in the main disk of \flower,
%the MC itself is gravitationally unbound and supported by turbulence (from the feedback of multiple episodes of \SF)
%and galactic rotation on large scales.
%% Turbulence in these substructures further dissipates in % e.g., shocks on even smaller scales, allowing sub-MCs to be bound and collapse.

For MCs in the satellite galaxies, we find even lower pressures and virial parameters, which are comparable to those found in clouds formed in the galactic disks  ($\alpha_{\rm vir}$\eq0.2$-$10; \citealt{Dobbs08a, Tasker09a}).
This suggests that MCs identified in the satellite galaxies are likely to be collapsing structures, and thus, \SF is expected to continue as gas from satellite galaxies is being accreted onto the main galaxies during the EoR.

are likely gravitationally unstable.
Close resemblance of the $Q_\star$ and $Q_{\rm eff}$ maps in the central region of \flower 
indicates that stellar component plays an important role in governing the stability of the MCs against $m=0$  perturbations, highlighting the importance of accounting for stellar contribution when examining the stability of molecular gas in relatively evolved and enriched systems at high redshifts.

\end{figure*}


Maps of the Toomre $Q$ parameters for the gas, stars, and the effective two-component $Q_{\rm eff}$ are shown in \Fig{Qeff}
(see also \Fig{h2density} for example of MCs identified in this evolutionary stage of \flower
using different $n_{\rm cut}$). 

Close resemblance of the $Q_{\rm eff}$ and $Q_{\star}$ maps indicates that contributions from the stellar component play an important role in governing the stability of the MCs against $m$\eq0 perturbations. This can be understood since stars in \flower dominates the central part of the galaxy in mass, so their gravitational potential provides a non-negligible contribution to the stability.

Similarly, contribution from the thickness of the disk is important in \flower since its disk warped and cannot be considered thin, i.e., 
it has a scale height to radius ratio of $h/r_{\rm gal}$\ssim150\,pc/1\,kpc\,$\simeq$\,0.15.

That is, some MCs are found in regions of $Q_{\rm gas}$\ssim1, 
which would suggest that they are gravitationally unstable;
however, when including the stabilizing effects due to its stellar potential and the
thickness of its disk (via $\sigma_z$), some of these MCs are consistent with $Q_{\rm eff} > 1$.
This highlights the importance of accounting for stellar contribution and disk thickness 
when examining the stability of molecular gas structures.
This consideration is especially relevant for the relatively evolved and enriched systems at high-$z$, 
that are preferentially being imaged at high resolution with ALMA.
% One should be caution when interpreting results based on gas-only Toomre $Q$ analysis.
In the outer regions of \flower, on the other hand, $Q_{\rm eff}$ resembles $Q_{\rm gas}$, with 
both $\log{Q_{\rm gas}}$ and $\log{Q_{\rm eff}} < -1$. 
Notably, these are the more gas-rich regions (see \Fig{sigma}).

The apparently large virial parameters seen in the MCs of \flower can be understood using the Toomre $Q$ parameter (see \Fig{Qeff}). We first note that fragmentation {\it can} happen in regions of low $Q$ (if we only consider instability against axisymmetric perturbations), but further evolution/collapse depends on the dynamics or equation of state of the gas.
%
Such fragmentation is expected to take place at the critical scale length $\lambda_{\rm crit} < 2 \pi^2 G \Sigma / \kappa^2$. Second, this fragmentation scale is greater than the typical size of GMCs. This could be interpreted as a result of instability setting the scales for fragmentation, but the star-forming GMCs correspond to the collapsing, denser, and cooler molecular structures that are on smaller scales.
%
Thus, the high virial parameter found for most MCs in \flower, which is the ratio between the velocity dispersion (accounts for effect of pressure and rotation) and surface density, indicate that most of them are not collapsing structures. As such, 
some MCs are found to lie in regions of $Q_{\rm eff}>1$.
% some MCs at Q < 1, some are marginally stable against m=0 mode perturb, some are Q>1.
Only in (the denser) regions with a low Toomre $Q_{\rm eff}$ parameter and when the cooling time is lower then the dynamical time star formation can proceed in {\it clumps} and {\it cores} with low virial parameters.

Note that even in stages when \flower~is star forming we find that most of its MCs have high $\alpha_{\rm vir}$. This seem to be self-contradictory: if most of the molecular gas in \flower are stable against collapse, how does it sustain its high SFR of $\sim$70\,\Msun\,yr\pmOne in the starburst phase? Such tension in the interpretation is understood as follows.
%
First, our results are limited by the resolution of the simulation, i.e., in \flower~we do not resolve \SF in {\it cores} and {\it clumps} as in the classical molecular cloud hierarchy. This re-iterates the statement about low $Q$ above.
%
Second, due to turbulence dissipation on small-scales, such (sub-)structures are no longer supported by large-scale gravitational potential and differential rotation. This in turn enables sub-regions of the MCs to collapse and potentially form OB associations out of these unbound MCs \citep{Clark04a, Clark05a}.
%
Further, mechanisms causing non-axisymmetric perturbations (e.g., arms) to the gravitational potential can induce orbit crossing, shocks and dissipation in gas, promoting turbulence dissipation and collapse on smaller scales to trigger \SF.
Finally, the SFR is very bursty and high SFR stages are transient.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}      \label{sec:conclusion}

We study the dynamical properties of molecular clouds complexes and their temporal evolution in a \z$\sim$\,6 prototypical galaxy, \flower,
at the EoR using state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulation (\ncode{Serra}),
which includes a chemical network to determine the formation of molecular
hydrogen, heating and cooling of the ISM by metals, and detailed stellar feedback.
We use a clump-finding algorithm and a set of H$_2$ volumetric densities
to identify MCs and their sub-structures in \flower and its satellites.
We decompose the molecular structures into non-overlapping tiles
by identifying a set of different density contours at different evolutionary stages.
Such identification method is similar to MC identification based on 
contour levels/surfaces of surface brightness maps/cubes of molecular line tracers (e.g., CO, CS, NH$_3$),
since the line luminosity scales with the molecular gas density (modulo optical depth effects).

We extract properties such as mass, size, Mach number, velocity dispersion, gas surface density, and virial parameter for each MC and we perform a Toomre-$Q$ stability analysis. The properties of the MCs in \flower are compared with observed MCs in the Milky Way disk, the Galactic center, and gas-rich starburst galaxies in the local Universe and at the peak epoch of cosmic \SF. This is done for different evolutionary stages of \flower.

We find that the MC of \flower are highly supersonic, with high velocity dispersions ($\sigma\approx$\,200\,\kms) comparable to
those observed in $z$\ssim2 starburst galaxies.
The mass scale of the MCs is of the order of $10^{5.5-8.5}$\,\Msun, depending on the chosen H$_{2}$ cut. 
The $\sim$200\,pc-scale MCs found with a low density threshold
correspond to the arms of the disk of \flower which break down into smaller $\lesssim$100\,pc-scale MCs at higher density thresholds.
The more massive and bigger MCs in \flower compared to the Milky Way
likely result from the higher gas mass fraction, surface density, and velocity dispersion,
which set the scale for fragmentation.
This physical scale is
consistent with what has been found in higher resolution idealized simulation of isolated galaxies.
Our simulation here confirms these results at EoR and under
the influence of continuous gas accretion from the surrounding IGM (see e.g., \citealt{Klessen10a, Goldbaum11a}).

We compare the dynamics of MCs in \flower to \obs in the context of the Larson's relation.
The MCs of \flower are found to have higher $\sigma$ and $\Sigma$ systematically regardless of the
density threshold $n_{\rm cut}$ adopted in identifying the structures.
 The found scaling relations are insensitive to the various density cuts. 
 The velocity dispersion remains $\gtrsim$100\,\kms even when we increase the density threshold and 
 even for the molecular substructures. 
 Such a high velocity dispersion likely results from the strong supernova and stellar feedback \flower experienced 
 over the multiple episodes of bursty \SF.

Virial analysis indicates that MC/arms of the main disk of \flower are unbound, but substructures have
lower virial parameter. Some of these sub-MCs have Toomre $Q_{\rm eff}$ parameters consistent with being
gravitationally unstable. This is consistent with the notion that collapsing structures resulting from
gravitational instability occur within globally stable structures, which are
supported by turbulence and rotation on large scale.
We also find $\alpha_{\rm vir}\approx$\,2 for MCs in the satellite galaxies, which we interpret as
result of the weaker/delayed stellar feedback compared to \flower. 
In particular, some of the MCs in the satellites are collapsing structures that have not yet formed stars, as confirmed by their
higher gas-to-stellar fractions.
In terms of the scaling relations examined, we do not observe any significant
temporal variations in the MC dynamics over the course of 700\,Myr traced in our simulation.

Determining the multi-phase ISM properties of early galaxies
is a critical piece to understanding the evolution and
assembly history of galaxies, since they set the pace
for chemical reactions and excitation rates for the coolants in the ISM (and subsequent star formation).
Observations leveraging the combination of spatial-spectral imaging of
multi-band continuum and spectral line emission are crucial for better understanding
the role of \highz galaxy populations
in the context of galaxy evolution and the ISM physics behind their intense star formation in the early Universe.
Cosmological zoom-in simulations, such as \ncode{Serra}, while inherently limited in galaxy
statistics and is subject to the sub-grid models adopted,
serve as an useful avenue/tool for examining and making predictions on the morphology and dynamics of
the molecular ISM of the first galaxies.
%Future higher resolution zoom-in simulations would certainly be useful to understand
%the evolving dynamical properties of the lower-mass molecular structures in
%galaxies at EoR under the influence of gas inflow/outflow (i.e., accounting for energy injection at large scale due to infall/outflow).
These predictions can in turn be
tested with high resolution imaging of the gas content in the first galaxies with telescopes such as ALMA and the ngVLA, thereby
enabling us to test our findings and refine future simulations to shed light on the physical processes behind
\SF since the cosmic dark ages.

\section{Variation in MC Properties Depending on the Choice of Density Cuts and Temporal Evolution in Cloud Dynamics}    \label{sec:ncut}
% single Snapshot
We investigate possible variations in the dynamics of the molecular structures of \flower and its satellites to test the robustness of our results against the choice of density threshold by adopting
different sets of $n_{\rm cut}$ in identifying the MCs.
That is, how sensitive are the structure properties, and thus, the results presented in \Sec{singless} dependent on the choice of density thresholds. We vary the choice of H$_2$ density for each of the evolutionary stages and find no obvious differences in our results (i.e., inferences on the dynamics of \z$\sim$\,6 MCs in relation to those observed in nearby and \z$\sim$2 galaxies in the context of
cloud scaling relations).
%
In addition, for the densest MC in the main disk of \flower, we find that while its size decreases as we increase $n_{\rm cut}$ --- as one would intuitively expect, the velocity dispersion remain approximately $\sigma\simeq$\,200\,\kms (see also \Fig{larsons_single}).
%
This lack of variation is reassuring, in the sense that at least on the scales studied here, the dynamics of the MCs are not artifacts or biased by our choice of $n_{\rm cut}$. Our results are therefore robust to the various density cuts of choice.

% temporal evolution in Cloud Dynamics
We show the properties of all MCs identified across all evolutionary stages in \Fig{larsons16-28} and \Fig{alpha16-28}. We find no quantitative differences in the cloud properties over the 700\,Myr traced in our simulation.
