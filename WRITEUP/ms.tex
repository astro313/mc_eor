\begin{abstract}
We study the dynamical properties of molecular cloud complexes (MC) in a prototypical galaxy (\flower)
at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) using cosmological zoom-in simulation.
%
We identify MCs using H$_2$ density, and compare their masses, sizes, velocity dispersions, gas surface densities, and virial parameters ($\alpha_{\rm vir}$) with those observed in nearby and \z$\sim$\,2 galaxies.
%
The MCs span a mass range of $10^{6.5-9}$\,\Msun and a size range of $R\lesssim200$\,pc. Their velocity dispersions and gas surface densities are systematically higher than those observed in nearby galaxies, but comparable to starburst galaxies.
%
We compute the effective two-component Toomre $Q_{\rm eff}$ parameter (gas and stars) to examine regions that are
gravitationally unstable.
%
We further perform virial analysis, which is accessible to observations, to examine regions that are likely
to undergo collapse. Our analysis indicates that MCs in the main disk of \flower are unbound, but its
substructures have lower virial parameters and Toomre $Q_{\rm eff}$, which is consistent
with the notion that collapsing structures occur within globally stable structures.
%
Our results suggest that the more massive and bigger MCs compared to the Milky Way manifest from the
higher gas mass fraction, surface density, and velocity dispersion.
% , which together sets the scale for fragmentation.
High resolution imaging of the first galaxies with the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) can furnish scrutinizing data to test our findings and shed light on \SF since the cosmic dark ages.

\section{Introduction}

\AP{i have to check abstract and Section 5., in particular 5.2; check also what have been moved to the app}

\AP{For some plots, still the old versions are the ones available. It might still be overleaf fault. An option would be to have a clean new overleaf document; pros: probably the compilation will be faster and the service less buggy (e.g., selecting every time the main manuscript file, files are actually uploaded, etc) and thus more convenient to use; cons: it will not be syncronized with the repo}

\DL{Maybe we will have to do it that way, and I will manually maintain my copy on the repo and on my macbook?}

The growth of galaxies and their subsequent evolution are governed by the baryon cycle --- galaxies accrete gas from the intergalactic medium (IGM) to fuel \SF (and feed their supermassive blackholes) and subsequent feedback replenishes and enriches the circumgalactic medium with part of this material. The general consensus is that the growth of \highz galaxies are triggered and supported by massive gas inflows from mergers and/or the cosmic web at early cosmic time, when the IGM and galaxies themselves are more gas-rich in their star-forming molecular gas contents compared to present-day galaxies.
%
These massive gas inflows in turn trigger gravitational instability and lead
to the formation of gas structures that are typically more massive and denser than those
observed in nearby galaxies, with masses of $M_{\rm cl}$\eq10$^9$\,\Msun
and sizes on sub-kpc scales (e.g., \citealt{Gabor13a, Hopkins14a, Inoue16a}).
Some theoretical works argue that the
migration of such giant massive clumps are responsible for contributing to the
buildup of the bulges of massive galaxies at \z$\sim$\,0 \citep[e.g.,][]{Ceverino10a}.

Given that \highz galaxies are the early stages of evolution of present-day galaxies, studying their ISM properties is essential for understanding how \SF proceed under these relatively more extreme conditions, thereby driving the evolution and assembly
of galaxies
since the cosmic dark ages.
Current consensus is that at higher redshifts, galaxies have higher
star formation rates \citep[SFR; ][]{Behroozi13b, Sparre15a, Maiolino15a, Dunlop17a} and
smaller sizes \citep[e.g.,][]{Bouwens11a, Ono13a} compared to those found in the local Universe.
The former are thus expected to have more \ion{H}{2} regions, ionized gas, and more intense radiation stellar feedbacks.
Since their metallicity and dust content are also expected to be lower as they are assembling,
this affects the shielding of UV photons, heating and cooling mechanisms in these early systems. Such differences in turn
affect the regulation of thermal and chemical structures of their ISM.
Their multi-phase ISM and the dynamics of the star-forming molecular cloud complexes (MC)
are therefore expected to differ from nearby galaxies.
Even in the local Universe, where the most detailed \obs can be attained, variations in cloud properties have been
observed between different galaxy populations (see e.g., \citealt{Hughes10a, Hughes13b}).
It is thus intuitive and reasonable to pose the question: what are the dynamical states of the MCs of the first galaxies and
how do they differ from the local Universe, and are they analogous to any seen in the local \galpop?
%

The FIR fine-structure lines (e.g., \cii, \nii, and \oiii), and CO and [\ci]~lines are the key diagnostics for
constraining the ISM conditions of a galaxy by
providing highly complementary information that trace different phases of the ISM (ionized,
atomic, molecular; e.g., \citealt{Scoville74a, Rubin85a, Malhotra01a}).
Global measurements of these diagnostics in \highz galaxies
have informed us on their galaxy-wide properties (e.g.,
gas masses, gas temperature, and radiation field intensity).
However, spatially resolving their ISM is necessary to understand their roles in galaxy evolution and
the physics behind their intense \SF (SFR\ssim100$-$3000\,\Msun\,yr\pmOne).
To date, spatially resolved ISM properties of \highz galaxies
have only been examine observationally in a handful of (strongly-lensed)
galaxies, using tracers such as
dust continuum, CO, and \cii lines (e.g., \citealt{Swinbank11a, Hodge15a, Ferkinhoff15a, Hodge16a, Leung19a}).
These studies find that galaxies at $z$\ssim2 galaxies, close to the peak of cosmic \SF, are more
molecular gas-rich, turbulent, and clumpy than nearby galaxies.
That said, it remains unclear how \SF proceed in the (sub-)$L^*$ galaxy population at \z$\gtrsim$\,6 ---
the epoch of reionization  ---
which is responsible for producing the
ionizing photons that reionized the Universe.
While ALMA has enabled the detections of
ISM diagnostic lines e.g., the \cii158\,$\micron$ and CO line emission in
normal (SFR$<$\,100\,\Msun\,yr\pmOne) galaxies at \z$>$\,6 over the past few years \citep[e.g.,][]{Odorico18a, Carniani18b},
we are still far from mapping their molecular ISM due to the cosmological dimming.
As such, we have undertaken a study, exploiting
state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulation
\ncode{Serra} (Greenhouse in Italian; \citealt{Pallottini17a, Pallottini17b}), with a goal to examine
and predict the dynamical properties of the star-forming molecular cloud complexes in a \z$\sim$6 prototypical (i.e., $L^*$)
galaxy. % to understand the physics behind \SF in the first galaxies.

%This paper is structured as follows. In \Sec{sim}, we describe the setup of our simulation and properties of our main galaxy (\flower), and describe the method used to identify its molecular gas complexes. In \Sec{eqn}, we present the formalism within which we interpret the results. In \Sec{results}, we present scaling relations for the MCs identified.

\section{Numerical simulations} \label{sec:sim}

\subsection{\ncode{Serra} Simulation\footnote{Serra means greenhouse in Italian which is motivated by the
fact that our simulation includes a chemical network to calculate the abundance of H$_2$, which in turn
dictates the formation of CO.
}}

The simulation used in this work is described by \citealt{Pallottini17a, Pallottini17b} and is briefly summarized here.
%
\ncode{Serra} is a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations performed using Eulerian hydrodynamics and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique to achieve high spatial resolution in the region of interest (i.e., regions of high density).
%
In particular, it uses a modified version of \ncode{ramses} \citep{Teyssier02a} as the AMR backend. Our simulation covers a co-moving box of 20\,Mpc $h$\pmOne in size, resolving down to a physical scale of $l\approx$\,30\,pc (at \z$\sim$\,6) and a (baryonic) mass resolution of $m_b\simeq$\,10$^4$\,\Msun at the finest level. Such a physical scale is close to the size scale of molecular cloud complexes and giant molecular clouds (GMCs) seen in nearby galaxies \citep[e.g.,][]{Sanders85a, Federrath13a, Goodman14a}.
%
We include chemical network in the simulation to trace $\rm{H}$, $\rm{H}^{+}$, $\rm{H}^{-}$, $\rm{He}$, $\rm{He}^{+}$, $\rm{He}^{++}$, $\rm{H}_2$, $\rm{H}_2^{+}$ \citep{Grassi14a,Bovino16a}. Of particular importance to our study here is that our simulation includes non-equilibrium formation of molecular hydrogen (done on-the-fly) to determine the H$_2$ abundance (see \citealt{Pallottini17b} for effects of chemistry affected by non-equilibrium versus equilibrium H$_2$ formation).

% radiative feedback --> NT pressure
Star formation is modeled using a H$_2$-based prescription of the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation \citep{Krumholz09a}. We adopt stellar tracks from \ncode{starburst99} and include stellar feedback from supernovae and OB/AGB stars to account for energy dissipations. To couple the feedback to the gas, we employ sub-grid modeling for blastwaves, e.g., to account for the potential lost of energy inside the cell during a supernova explosion. The energy dissipated is then injected into the ISM in the form of kinetic and thermal energies. Radiation pressure on the dust and gas is also included (see \citealt{Pallottini17a} for details).

Details on the properties of \flower\ --- the main galaxy in our simulation --- are discussed in \citet{Pallottini17b}. Briefly, by \z$\sim$6, \flower is a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG), hosted in a dark matter halo of mass $M_{\rm DM}\simeq$\,10$^{10}$\,\Msun at the center of a cosmic web knot, and accretes mass from the IGM mainly via three filaments of length $\simeq$\,100\,kpc. At \z$\sim$6, \flower has a stellar mass of $M_*\simeq$\,3\E{10}\,\Msun, a metallicity of $Z\simeq$\,0.5\,$Z_{\odot}$, a molecular gas mass of $M_{\rm H2}\simeq$\,5\E{7}\,\Msun, and a globally-integrated SFR of $\simeq$\,100\,\Msun\,yr\pmOne. It is therefore a prototypical galaxy at \z$\sim$\,6.
For reference, the half mass radius of \flower is $\sim$0.5\,kpc and the dark matter virial radius at which the mean enclosed density is 200 times the critical density of the Universe is $r_{\rm 200}\simeq$\,15\,kpc.

The simulation data contain information such as the density ($\rho$) and velocity ($v_x$, $v_y$, and $v_z$) fields, from which we calculate the physical properties of each MC, such as mass and velocity dispersion. Due to the nature of our AMR simulation, we regrid the simulation data into uniform grids for the analysis presented in this paper. The grid size is defined based on the highest resolution of the simulation data (i.e., the less refined regions are supersampled in the resulting uniform grids).

\subsection{Star Formation History} \label{sec:sfh}
One of the main advantages for studying the dynamical properties of molecular structures at $z$\ssim6 in simulation is the fact that we can examine how their properties evolve as a function of time.
%
This is advantageous especially at early cosmic epochs, when the densest structures are beginning to form; gas is constantly being accreted onto the central galaxy from the cosmic web and satellite galaxies, thereby leading to bursts of \SF. Meanwhile, tidal forces resulting from interactions with these surrounding galaxies can disrupt the main disk and arms, likely leading to different dynamical states for the molecular structures compared to more evolved galaxies found at a later cosmic time (e.g., some molecular structures may disperse while others may agglomerate into more massive ones). % mainly expecting differences in alpha_vir, sigma, M_cl.

\begin{figure*}[!htbp]

    one of its major starburst phases after a merger event; and {\it (c)}
    a relatively quiescent phase post-starburst.
\label{fig:SFH}}
\end{figure*}

We show the \SF history of \flower in \Fig{SFH}, where the SFR is calculated based on existing young stellar population, which is defined to have an age of $t_{\rm age}<$\,10\,Myr. The SFR of \flower varies between $\sim$30$-$80\,\Msun\,yr\pmOne\footnote{The SFR plotted in Figure 2 of \citet{Pallottini17b} is a factor of two higher than shown here since they also include contributions from massive satellite galaxies within the surrounding $\approx$15\,kpc ($\simeq$ to the virial radius).} as it evolves from an actively accreting phase to a starburst phase after a major merger, and then back to a relatively quiescent phase, over the few hundred Myr simulated in the simulation.

Given the stochasticity in the \SF history of \flower (see \Fig{SFH}), we focus this work on the analysis of two of its most extreme evolutionary
stages (see \Sec{singless}), to illustrate the salient points of discussion presented in this paper.
The two phases correspond to i) when \flower
is accreting materials from its surrounding  and ii) when \flower is undergoing a major starburst phase; such phases are expected to bracket the most extreme variations in the cloud dynamics.
For completeness, we also show the results (in terms of the scaling relations presented) for
the other evolutionary stages traced in the simulation.

Throughout this paper, we call ``satellite galaxies'' as dense gas regions outside the main disk of \flower,
which is $\sim$\,1\,kpc in radius.

\section{Molecular Cloud Complexes}\label{sec:eqn}

\subsection{Structure Identification}\label{sec:method}

To identify the molecular complexes, we use a customized version of the clump-finding algorithm available in the \ncode{python} package \ncode{yt} \citep{Turk11a}, which was initially described in \citet{Smith09a}, but this function has been modified since then.
%
The latest version of the default \ncode{yt} clump finder decomposes the zones in the simulation into non-overlapping tiles, which are stored in a k-dimensional tree (k-d tree). It then identifies the contours of a variable field (here, the density field) within a tile and connects them across the tiles. In the customized version used for this study, we modify the function to enhance the stability of the code.
% (which essentially means we fixed the bugs in order for it to actually work).

In the ``clump-finding'' process, we employ a set of different density thresholds defined based on the molecular hydrogen density of \flower
at different evolutionary stages (between redshifts of $z$\eq6.0\,$-$\,7.2). We
note that this process is in essence similar to identifying molecular structures based on the noise levels of surface density maps observers obtain with telescopes, using molecular line tracers such as CO, CS, and HCN, as commonly adopted in observational studies (e.g., identifying ``clumps'' based on/after applying $\sigma$-clipping, using tools such as \ncode{aips}'s task \ncode{serch}, \ncode{clumpfind}, and \ncode{cprops}; \citealt{Williams94a, Oka01a, Rosolowsky06a, Rosolowsky08a}).

We note that, owing to the nature of \obs, such structures are identified in position-position-velocity (PPV) space, whereas in simulations, one has the full 6D spatial-kinematic information, and can therefore cleanly identify structures directly using the density field in position-position-position (PPP) space.
% Many concerning the correspondence between  ... , dating back to the work by \citep{Adler92a}.
Existing studies find a good correspondence in the dynamical properties extracted in PPV- versus PPP-space (\citealt{Ballesteros-Paredes02a, Heitsch09a, Shetty10a, Beaumont13a, Pan15a}, but see also \citealt{Shetty10a} for a discussion on caveats and limitations).
% large scale structure in PPP may be identified as numerous lower mass structures in the PPV cube due to gradients in the LOS and conversly, superposition when spatially distinct components with the same velocity are "merged" into one component in the PPV space when observed along the LOS (see Fig. 1 of Beaumount13a). (may be worth putting more thoughts on this after the report is due).

% \addtocounter{figure}{-1}
\end{figure*}

In \Fig{h2density}, we show an example of the volumetric H$_2$ density ($n_{\rm H2}$) distribution of \flower~for a given evolutionary stage which includes contributions within $R\sim$\,3.5\,kpc from the galaxy center.
%
We note that the distribution is almost flat for $n_{\rm H2}\gtrsim1$\,\cc and it samples the range of density where ``clumps/structures'' are found based on the Euler characteristic, i.e., the fourth Minkowsky functional (see \citealt{Pallottini17b}). We identify MCs by applying 10 equally-spaced volumetric H$_2$ density cuts of $\log{(n_{\rm cut}/{\rm cm^{-3})}}\in[-0.5, 1.5]$\eq[0.32, 0.53, 0.88, 1.45, 2.45, 4.08, 6.81, 11.36, 19.00, 31.62]\footnote{We also vary the range of $n_{\rm cut}$ adopted and find no qualitative differences affecting the results and conclusions of this work except in the slope of the CMF (see \Sec{ncut}).} to each snapshot.

For visualization purposes, we overplot the molecular structures identified using a subset of the volumetric H2 density cuts
($n_{\rm cut}$\eq0.53, 6.81, and 19.00\,\cc) on the H$_2$ density maps as an example (see \Fig{MC}).
The plots shown in \Fig{MC} are weighted by the column density of the total gas content.
% equation below for bookkeeping:
% ${\rm pixel_i}$\eq$\frac{\sum_i~\rho_{\rm H2, i}~w_i~\Delta z_i}{\sum_i~w_i~\Delta z_i}$,
% where $\rho_{\rm H2, i}$ is the H$_2$ density of pixel $i$, $w_i$ is the weighted quantity in pixel $i$ which we adopt
% to be the total gas density, and $\Delta z_i$ is the path length of pixel $i$ along the line-of-sight over which the quantities are integrated along.

Since the molecular structures identified could easily appear as overlapping structures depending on the viewing angle, we also plot them in different three-dimensional projections (right panels of \Fig{MC}) --- so that one can more easily see that they are collections of disjoint structures.
%
We repeat this identification process for 14 evolutionary stages between redshift \z$\in$[6.0, 7.2], spaced by $\Delta t$\eq50\,Myr.

Limited by the spatial resolution of our simulation ($l_{\rm cell}\simeq$\,30\,pc), we impose an addition constraint such that an identified structure only survives if it spans at least 10 cells in PPP space. We caution that one caveats of such constraint is that we can only examine the parameter space of ``cloud'' scaling relations at ``cloud'' size $R\gtrsim100$\,pc.

%\subsection{Key Properties of Clouds}
\subsection{Properties of the Clouds}

% Molecular clouds are the natal place for \SF, their structure and dynamics hold important clues to understanding
% the mechanisms and physics of formation and evolution of molecular structures and \SF.
Upon identifying the molecular structures, we extract properties such as the H$_2$ gas mass ($M_{\rm cl}$), effective size ($R$), Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$), velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), and gas surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm gas}$) to examine their dynamics.

The mass of an MC is calculated from the uniformly-gridded 3D density field, integrating over the MC volume $V$. The effective size is defined assuming spherical geometry, i.e. $R \equiv (3 V /4 \pi)^{1/3}$.
%
The velocity dispersion of MCs is calculated from non-thermal velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm NT}$) and thermal sound speed ($c_s$):
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2 = \sigma_{\rm NT}^2 + c_s^2.
\label{eqn:veldisp}
\end{equation}
%
In \obs of MC, the linewidths contribution of dense gas contribution is larger then the one from the diffuse gas. We therefore calculate
each term on the RHS of Equation~\ref{eqn:veldisp} as a density-weighted quantity. For instance, the non-thermal velocity dispersion is
calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\rm NT}^2 = \frac{1}{{3}}\frac{\sum_{i} \rho_i \left|\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{\bar v}\right|^2}{\sum_i \rho_i}\,,
\end{equation}
where the sum is done for the cells composing each MC.
The local sound speed of all identified molecular complexes are much smaller compared to the their turbulent velocities\footnote{We find comparable velocity dispersion between that derived from taking the root mean square versus that derived from thermal and non-thermal pressure terms, indicating that rotation velocity is unlikely to be the dominant source of velocity dispersion reported here.\label{ftn:veldisp}}.
On average, the Mach number of the MCs corresponds to about $\mathcal{M} = \sigma_{\rm NT}/c_s\approx 50$. This is consistent with the global analysis done on \flower by \citet{Vallini18a}.

We show in \Fig{dist} the MC distributions in terms of their molecular gas masses, radii, and gas mass fractions, which we define as
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm gas} = \frac{M_{\rm cl}} {\left(M_{\rm cl} + M_*\right)},
\end{equation}
where $M_*$ is the stellar mass within the MC volume.
%
We note that the distributions vary for different evolutionary stage of \flower. The highest density threshold of $n_{\rm cut}$\eq31.62\,\cc yields a ``minimum'' MC mass of the order of 10$^{6.5}$\,\Msun for the densest MC.
%
We find $\sim$10$-$13 MCs with masses exceeding 10$^8$\,\Msun across all the evolutionary stages considered in this work,
for each of the given $n_{\rm cut}$ (see \Sec{method}). The mass of the MCs identified ranges between $M_{\rm cl}\approx$10$^{6.5-9}$\,\Msun, consistent with those observed in \z$\sim$2 galaxies in rest-frame {\it UV and optical light} \citep{Elmegreen07a, Elmegreen09a}.

%\subsection{Virial Equilibrium and Larson's Relations}\label{sec:PVE}
\subsection{Larson's Relations}\label{sec:PVE}

In next sections, we examine and compare properties of the MCs with observations in the context of the Larson's relations \citep{Larson81a}. Namely, the linewidth-size, density-size, and mass-size relations. Larson's relations are adopted for the discussion in this work as they  describe the interactions between gravity and turbulence, and is the first set of relations used for studying star-forming molecular structure formation based on observables which has been routinely used for comparing properties of molecular structures in different galactic environments.
% Inner MW: R=2-8.5 kpc, most of the mass in the molecular ISM is in the form of GMCs with sizes $gtrsim$20\,pc and masses greater than 10$^5$\,\Msun \citep{Sanders85a}.

% Relating Larson's law to stability and pressure (perhaps move this to other section?).
In general, the virial theorem for a distribution of gas can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:virial_th_general}
\frac{1}{2}\ddot I = 2(T - T_{\rm ext}) + W,
\end{equation}
where $\ddot I$ is the second time derivative of the Lagrangian moment of inertia, $T$ is the internal energy of the gas, $T_s$ is external pressure support, and $W$ is the gravity energy.
%
Let us specialize to the case of a spherical self-gravitating molecular cloud of mass $M_{\rm cl}$, radius $R$, and velocity dispersion $\sigma$, accounting for both thermal and turbulent velocity dispersion. Neglecting magnetic field and calling $P_{\rm ext}$ the external pressure, \Eq{virial_th_general} can be written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}\ddot I = 3 M_{\rm cl} \sigma^2 - 4\pi P_{\rm ext} R - \frac{\Gamma GM_{\rm cl}^2}{R}\,,
\label{eqn:virial}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ is a geometrical factor that is equal to 3/5 for a uniform sphere; in \Eq{virial} the first term on the right hand side (RHS) is the pressure term from internal velocity dispersion, the second term the external pressure term, and the third term is is the gravity term. For the case of simple virial equilibrium (SVE; i.e., equilibrium state without external pressure), \Eq{virial} becomes:
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{\rm vir} \equiv \frac{3\sigma^2}{\Gamma GM_{\rm cl}/R} = \frac{5\sigma^2R}{GM_{\rm cl}}\,,
\label{eqn:alpha}
\end{equation}
which is also the defined as the virial parameter $\alpha_{\rm vir}$.

Motivated by the Larson's linewidth-size relation \citep{Larson81a} and the work by \citet{Heyer09a},
we recast Equation~\ref{eqn:alpha} into the form of:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2/R = \pi G \Sigma/5\,,
\label{eqn:SVE}
\end{equation}
for gas in virial equilibrium (i.e., by setting $\alpha_{\rm vir}$\eq1).
On the other hand, for pressure-bounded virial equilibrium (PVE; i.e. equilibrium state with pressure), % external pressure
Equation~\ref{eqn:virial} becomes:
\begin{equation}
P_{\rm ext} = \frac{3\sigma^2M_{\rm cl}}{4\pi R^3} - \frac{\Gamma G M_{\rm cl}^2}{4\pi R^4},
\label{eqn:pext}
\end{equation}
which describes how much external pressure is needed to confine the gas inside a given volume.
Substituting surface density $\Sigma$\eq$M/\pi R^2$ into Equation~\ref{eqn:pext}, we can express it with the following:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sigma^2}{R} = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{4P_{\rm ext}}{\Sigma} + \Gamma G \Sigma \pi \right)\,,
\label{eqn:v0}
\end{equation}
keeping $\sigma^2/R$ on the LHS.

Based on Equations~\ref{eqn:SVE} and \ref{eqn:pext}, a one-to-one mapping
between $\sigma^2/R$ and $\Sigma$ is therefore expected for a virialized cloud,
since $\sigma^2/R\propto\Sigma$. Equation~\ref{eqn:v0}
then yields the loci along which external pressures $P_{\rm ext}$ are needed in order for some given MCs to have
linewidths $\sigma$ for a given set of surface densities. % (see\Fig{alpha27}).
In other words, a cloud with $\sigma$ and $\Sigma$ offset from $\sigma^2/R\mapsto\Sigma$ is in equilibrium with
external pressure $P_{\rm ext}$ (and therefore $\sigma^2/R$ is not constant
with $\Sigma$ but varies depending on $P_{\rm ext}$; cf.
expectation for SVE, where $\sigma\propto R^{0.5}$; see e.g., \citealt{Heyer09a, Hughes10a, Hughes13b, Meidt13a}).

Summarizing, we use the virial parameter (\Eq{alpha}) to quantify the stability of an MC.
An $\alpha_{\rm vir}\approx$\,2 corresponds to approximately equipartition between gravitational and kinetic energies, and is
 often used to assess the boundedness of a given structure in \obs \citep[see e.g., ][]{Kauffmann17b}\footnote{Note, however, that the true virial state/boundedness of a given structure also depends on the surface terms and the magnetic field (see \Eq{virial}).}.
To facilitate comparison with \obs, we derive $\alpha_{\rm vir}$ using the gas component only and ignore contributions due to
the stellar component.

%\subsection{Gravitational Instabilities}\label{sec:Q}
\subsection{Toomre Stability}\label{sec:Q}

The onset of gravitational instability is considered to be tightly connected to \SF \citep[e.g.,][]{Kennicutt89a, Wang94a, Li05b, Li06a}. \AP{i think we can partially cut the following} \DL{probably, but I am just being explicit here to help remind myself what am I trying to say.}
From virial theorem, Jeans instability sets the scales at which gravitational potential overcomes the internal energy. Namely, gravitational instabilities dominates at scales $L > L_J$, where $L_J$ is the Jeans length. However, centrifugal force resulting from differential rotation in disk galaxies can inhibit collapse even on these scales. As a result, a disk is thought to be unstable on scales between $L_J < L < L_{\rm rot}$, where $L_{\rm rot}$ is set by the surface density of the disk and the angular velocity of the rotation.

In theoretical and observational works, gravitational instability has been widely discussed in the context of the Toomre stability criterion \citep{Toomre64a, Goldreich65b}, or the Toomre $Q$ parameter (\AP{i would put this parenthesis as a note later on, i.e. close to \Eq{q_eff}} or the proxy, circular velocity to dispersion ratio; $v_{\rm circ}/\sigma$; e.g., \citealt{GarciaBurillo03a, Genzel11a, Kassin12a, Leung19a}).
% https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March15/Glazebrook/Glazebrook5.html
%
% from linear analysis
For {\it axisymmetric} mode, the dispersion relation for the growth of density perturbation in a rotating turbulent disk of
finite thickness $h$ is described by
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = \kappa^2 - \frac{2\pi G \Sigma |k|}{1 + |k| h} + \sigma^2 k^2\,,
\label{eqn:3Ddisp}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the wavenumber and $\kappa$ is the epicyclic frequency, defined as:
\begin{equation}
\kappa^2\equiv\frac{2\Omega}{R}\frac{d}{dR}\left(R^2\Omega\right)\,,
\label{eqn:kappa}
\end{equation}
\citep{Romeo92a}.
The first term on the RHS of Equation~\ref{eqn:3Ddisp} describes rotation support, whereas the second term describes self-gravity, and the third term describes internal pressure support. The Toomre-Q parameter can be defined as \citep{Toomre64a}:
\begin{equation}
Q_{\rm gas}\equiv\frac{\sigma\kappa}{\pi G \Sigma}\,.
\label{eqn:Q}
\end{equation}
In the thin disk approximation ($kh\ll1$), the solution of \Eq{3Ddisp} is unstable for scales $k$ such that 
$Q < Q_{\rm crit}\simeq1$ (or equivalently $\omega^2 < 0$). Physically, this situation happens when local gravitational instability
overcomes support from pressure and rotation, allowing fragmentation and collapse to happen.
Similarly, for a collisionless fluid --- as an ensemble of stars --- the Toomre $Q$ parameter is defined by \citep{Toomre64a}:
\begin{equation}
Q_{\star} \equiv\frac{\sigma\kappa}{3.36 G \Sigma}\,.
\end{equation}

In our stability analysis, we account for a non-negligible disk thickness and for the combined effect of gas and stars; this is done adopting the approximation for an effective two-component $Q_{\rm eff}$ parameter \citep[i.e.,][see also \citealt{Inoue16a}]{Romeo11a}.
%
The effect of disk thickness modify the $Q$ parameter for gas/star by accounting for the vertical velocity dispersion:
\begin{equation}
T_{x} = \left\{
		\begin{array}{lccr}
			{\displaystyle 0.8 + 0.7\left(\frac{\sigma_{z}}{\sigma_{r}}\right)}      && & \mbox{if\ } \sigma_z \lesssim 0.5 \times \sigma_r \\ [1.25em]
			{\displaystyle 1 + 0.6\left(\frac{\sigma_{z}}{\sigma_{r}}\right)}        & & & \mbox{if\ } \sigma_z \gtrsim 0.5 \times \sigma_r
\\
		\end{array}
	\right.
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
Q^{\rm thick}_{x} = T_{x} Q\,,
\end{equation}
with $x$ indicating either gas or stars.
% Note that w/ thickness, there's the a self-gravity dilution term in the dispersion relation, which in effect reduceds the surface gravity in the vertical direction. As such, it is easier to be stable against gravitaional instability. Thus, the criterion for instability $Q$ is reduced.
%
The combined effect of gas and stars can then be accounted for by writing
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:q_eff}
Q^{-1}_{\rm eff} =  \left\{
				\begin{array}{lccr}
					     {\displaystyle\frac{w}{Q^{\rm thick}_{\rm star}} + \frac{1}{Q^{\rm thick}_{\rm gas}}}      & & & \mbox{if\ }  Q^{\rm thick}_{\rm star} \geq Q^{\rm thick}_{\rm gas} \\ [0.75em]
                                               {\displaystyle\frac{1}{Q^{\rm thick}_{\rm star}} + \frac{w}{Q^{\rm thick}_{\rm gas}}}      & & & \mbox{if\ } Q^{\rm thick}_{\rm star} \leq Q^{\rm thick}_{\rm gas} \\
				\end{array}
			    \right.
\end{equation}
where the relative weight $w$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
w\equiv\frac{2 \sigma_{\star} \sigma_{\rm gas}}{\sigma_{\star}^2 + \sigma_{\rm gas}^2},
\end{equation}
Conceptually, the thickness of a disk reduces the gravity in the vertical direction, thereby making 
a system easier to obtain stability, and thus, lowering the criterion of the critical Toomre 
$Q_{\rm crit}$ from $\simeq$\,1 to 
0.67 \citep{Goldreich65a}. On the other hand, including the contribution of the stellar 
component promotes gravitational instability, and thus, increasing the criterion of the Toomre $Q_{\rm crit}$.
unless it is dynamically hot to ``compensate''.  
As a rule of thumb, $Q_{\rm crit}\eq1.34$ for $Q_{\rm gas}$\eq$Q_\star$.  % 0.67 * 2

behind relating aa with bb and bb and cc, etc, in the Larson's relations?}

\subsection{Single Evolutionary Stage}  \label{sec:singless}

For each of the two most extreme evolutionary stages of \flower\ --- accretion and starburst phase (see \Sec{sfh}), we identify a set of MCs.
%
Scaling relations for the MCs identified in the accretion phase are shown in left panels of \Fig{larsons_single} and in the right
panels for the starburst phase.
%
Regardless of the H$_2$ density cuts adopted, the MCs are found to have consistently \AP{which is already said in the last part of previous Sec.; I would put here that part} \DL{?}
high turbulences and surface densities in both stages. These correspond to MCs at the center of the main disk of \flower and occupy the top right corner of the Larson's relation shown in \Fig{larsons_single}.
%
As we increase the density threshold, some of the MCs within the main disk break into multiple sub-MCs. As such, we effectively identify a population of denser molecular structures (see \Fig{MC}).

% PVE
We also compare the MCs identified in our simulations to those observed in the Milky Way in the context of the $\sigma^2/R - \Sigma$ relation (see bottom panels of \Fig{larsons_single}). Dashed lines in the figure show the loci along which the given external pressures are
needed for MCs to have certain linewidths for a given set of surface densities (see \Sec{PVE}).
% (Rice+16) find variation in $V_0^2$, where they find larger linewidths for GMCs in inner galactic disk, but they find that the clouds in the Galactic disk are still consistent with SVE (see also Solomon87a ; cf. Heyer+09).
The MCs in the satellite galaxies are found to follow the locus of $\log{(P/\textrm{K cm}^{-3})}$\eq6, which
is consistent with that found for the bulk of dense gas in the simulation in the phase-space analysis presented in \citet{Pallottini17a}.

% cloud structures at large and small scale
% Larson's: m = 460 M_sun (r_pc)^1.9 for structure w/in molecular clouds. --> $m \propto r^2$ \citep{McKee07a} (law of constant
% column density) as fundamental properties of molecular cloud structure.
Larson's third relation describes fundamental properties of molecular clouds, relating their structures on small and large scales via two physical properties: mass and size \citep{Larson81a, McKee07a}. This is also known as the law of constant column density, since cloud mass in \obs is sometimes derived by integrating over the mass surface density, which is related to the column density ($N_{\rm H2}$) obtainable from extinction maps ($A_V$). That is, $N_{\rm H2}\propto A_V$, $\Sigma\propto N_{\rm H2}$, and $M$\eq$\int \Sigma~dA$. Therefore, cloud mass is related to $N_{\rm H2}$ and $A_V$.

We show in \Fig{MR} the size-mass relation of the MCs of \flower compared to observational data of molecular clouds in the Milky Way that are found to be associated with massive \SF \citep{Beuther02a, Mueller02a, Hill05a, Motte07a} and an empirical relation obtained for massive \SF based on Milky Way clouds ($<$10\,\Msun; \citealt{Kauffmann10b, Kauffmann10c} and references therein): $M \gtrsim 870$\,\Msun$\times\,\left(r/{\rm pc}\right)^{1.33}$.
%
In the same plot, we also show loci of constant surface densities, which are parameterized through the visual extinction $A_V$. As shown in \Fig{MR}, the MCs identified in \flower lie above this relation, along the locus with a visual extinction of $A_V$\eq4\,mag \citep{Lombardi10a}. We discuss this result in the Discussion section.

The colored lines show the loci expected for various visual extinctions ($A_V$), which corresponds to lines of constant surface density (i.e., Larson's third relation). This representation is motivated by observational studies (see text and e.g., \citealt{Lombardi10a}).

\subsection{Temporal Evolution and Adopted Density Threshold Dependence}\label{sec:ncut}
% single Snapshot
We investigate possible variations in the dynamics of the molecular structures of \flower and its satellites to test the robustness of our results against the choice of density threshold by adopting
different sets of $n_{\rm cut}$ in identifying the MCs.
%
That is, how sensitive are the structure properties, and thus, the results presented in \Sec{singless} dependent on the choice of density thresholds. We vary the choice of H$_2$ density for each of the evolutionary stages and find no obvious differences in our results (i.e., inferences on the dynamics of \z$\sim$\,6 MCs in relation to those observed in nearby and \z$\sim$2 galaxies in the context of
cloud scaling relations).
%
In addition, for the densest MC in the main disk of \flower, we find that while its size decreases as we increase $n_{\rm cut}$ --- as one would intuitively expect, the velocity dispersion remain approximately $\sigma\simeq$\,200\,\kms (see also \Fig{larsons_single}).
%
This lack of variation is reassuring, in the sense that at least on the scales studied here, the dynamics of the MCs are not artifacts or biased by our choice of $n_{\rm cut}$. Our results are therefore robust to the various density cuts of choice.

% temporal evolution in Cloud Dynamics
We show the properties of all MCs identified across all evolutionary stages in \Fig{alpha16-28}. We find no quantitative differences in the cloud properties over the 700\,Myr traced in our simulation.

\section{Discussions and Implications}\label{sec:diss}

\subsection{Placing Results in the Context of Existing Observations} \label{sec:diss1}

The MCs of \flower has dynamics largely similar to those observed in $z$\ssim2 spatially resolved studies of gas-rich star-forming galaxies, in terms of their velocity dispersions, sizes, and gas surface densities (\Fig{larsons_single}; see e.g., \citealt{Swinbank11a}), with sizes of the order of $R\simeq$\,100\,pc and velocity dispersions of $\sigma\simeq$\,20$-$80\,\kms.
%
% velocity dispersion, larsons
%
Their velocity dispersions are also comparable to those observed in the inner Milky way and nearby gas-rich galaxies (e.g., M64; \citealt{Oka01a, Rosolowsky05a, Heyer09a}), which lies along the locus of $\sigma\propto R^{0.56}$. Such high velocity dispersions and surface densities are expected since they are located in the nuclear regions of the galaxy, where the potential well is also deep. The higher velocity dispersions
(see footnote~\ref{ftn:veldisp} on page \pageref{ftn:veldisp}) of these MCs can also be understood as they have experienced more recent episodes of \SF as \flower is assembling its stellar mass (these MCs also have higher stellar-to-gas mass ratios of $\sim$60).
%
In fact, by $z\simeq$\,7.2 (\AP{i would always refer to the evolutionary stage name, once in defined in Fig. 1; we might want to use italic to underline it is a definition} i.e., accretion phase; see \Fig{SFH}a), \flower has assembled a stellar mass of $M_*$\eq7.5\E{9}\,\Msun. Thus, the higher velocity dispersion is due in part to the stronger stellar feedback compared to e.g., MCs in its satellite galaxies ($\sigma\approx$10\,\kms).


The high pressure observed in \flower is comparable to what has been observed in local ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs); however, the molecular clouds in the latter are concentrated within their central regions and have typical sizes of $\sim$70-100\,pc and masses on the order of $\sim$10$^9$\,\Msun \citep{Downes98a, Sakamoto08a}. In our simulated galaxy, the high pressure MCs of \flower are found throughout the disk. This difference likely stems from the different physical mechanisms giving rise to the formation (and thus the nature) of these molecular structures.
%
For instance, in local ULIRGs, they are likely form by shock compression and cloud-cloud collision after large amount of gas from the pair of progenitor galaxies are being funneled toward the central region \citep{Tan00a, Wu18a}.
% Tasker09a
On the other hand, the highly turbulent structures of \flower likely result from constant cold gas accretion onto the entire galaxy \AP{i do not fully grasp the following point} \DL{doesn't it take a long time for gas to lose angular 
momentum to fall onto the central region of a galaxy? Given turbulent it is across the entire galaxy \Fig{sigma}, 
isn't more conceivable that cold gas accretion is the dominant reason to the turbulent structures in \flower?} 
(without requiring gas to be funneled into the central region).
This latter mechanism may also be the dominant mode for forming the highly supersonic massive MCs observed in gas-rich star-forming galaxies at $z$\ssim2 (see also e.g., \citealt{Swinbank11a}) --- but the observed size scales could also result from resolution limit where the true physical scales of MCs in $z$\,\ssim2 galaxies could be smaller in reality.
%
The constant inter-cloud collision as gas is being accreted onto the main galaxy would also render
the MCs to be gravitationally unbound (see e.g., \citealt{Dobbs11a}), which is
consistent with the high $\alpha_{\rm vir}$ found for the MCs in the main disk of \flower.

% mass-size relation
In terms of the mass-size relation (\Fig{MR}), the MCs of \flower are found to lie above the \citet{Kauffmann10c} relation, which is an empirical relation corresponding to the threshold for massive \SF, but lies
%The implication of this \citet{Kauffmann10c} relation is that cluster-forming cloud fragments are
%found to be more massive than those that are devoid of clusters
%at a given radius.
below the locus of $A_V$\eq100\,mag followed by Milky Way clouds. This can be understood by acknowledging the fact that a H$_2$ molecular cloud does not necessary contain CO (e.g., as CO forms deeper in molecular clouds), and that our simulation does not have enough resolution to directly form CO\footnote{In fact, to form CO and make predictions for CO line emission in the work presented by \citet{Vallini18a}, we model the internal structure of MC within each cell in our simulation.}.
%
That is, the MCs of \flower lying along the locus of $A_V$\eq4\,mag likely manifests from the fact that the MCs in our simulation have lower column densities than the star-forming cores observed in the Milky Way, which are observationally well-resolved within an MC, and indeed, have sufficient column density to form CO.

In the scaling relations examined, we find similar MC properties in relation to those observed in the nearby Universe between the accretion phase and the starburst phase of \flower (see \Fig{larsons_single}). That is, we do not find any quantitative major differences in the MC properties between the accretion and the starburst phase, which are separated by $\simeq$300\,Myr.

\subsection{Origin and Physical Scales of MCs} \label{sec:origin}

The largest molecular structure identified is essentially the main disk of \flower and breaks down into smaller substructures that are denser as we increase $n_{\rm cut}$ (see e.g., \Fig{alpha16-28}). Overall, the MCs we identified are much bigger in size and mass than nearby GMCs, but comparable to those observed in $z$\,\ssim2$-$4 galaxies based on spatially resolved imaging \citep{Swinbank11a}.

% mass scale
Observations of nearby gas-rich galaxies such as M64 and NGC\,253 show higher velocity dispersions compared to the disk/mid-plane of the Milky Way but consistent with those observed in the inner regions of Milky Way and M51 \citep{Oka01a, Rosolowsky05a, Heyer09a, Hughes13b, Leroy15a, Rice16a}.  % also higher $P_{\rm int}$,
% which is $\propto\rho\sigma^2$
% M51: Colombo+14
However, clouds in nearby gas-rich galaxies are bigger in size (approximately an order of magnitude) and mass (approximately two orders of magnitude).
These bigger clouds have been interpreted as a result of their higher gas mass fractions, surface densities, and velocity dispersions,
since fragmentation occurs near the Jeans length $L_J\propto\sigma^2/\Sigma$ and
Jeans mass $M_J\propto\sigma^4/\Sigma$ for dispersion-supported structures.

Based on the scaling of $M_J$\eq$\sigma^4/(G^2\Sigma)$ for the Jeans mass, a
velocity dispersion of $\sigma\approx50$\,\kms and a
gas mass surface density of $\Sigma_{\rm gas}\approx450$\,\Msun\,pc$^{-2}$ yields
$M_J\sim$\,8\E{8}\,\Msun, which is in good agreement with the mass range found in the MCs identified (see \Fig{dist}).
%
Similarly massive molecular clouds have been reported in idealized closed-box isolated galaxy simulations done at higher resolution (e.g., a maximum
resolution of 3\,pc in the 48\,kpc box studied by \citealt{Behrendt16a}).
Note, however, that the IGM and merger and accretion histories are not properly modeled in such simulations since they adopt non-cosmological initial conditions. That said, this is reassuring --- our results are not far off in spite of the limited resolution ($l_{\rm cell}\approx$\,30\,pc).

%Note that regions of $Q\lesssim1$ is actually somewhat
%less than the number of MCs we have identified based on density threshold ---
%but this has something to do with the dependence on
%$n_{\rm cut}$. The number of MCs and regions of low $Q$ are comparable if we only look at
%MCs identified at the highest $n_{\rm cut}$.

% alpha parameters
As shown in \Fig{larsons_single},
the virial parameter of the sub-MCs is about $\alpha_{\rm vir}\gtrsim10$, which is considerably lower than their ``parent'' MCs found in the main disk of \flower ($\alpha_{\rm vir}\gtrsim100$).
%
For the MCs in the satellite galaxies, a lower virial parameter is found compared to the (sub-)MCs in the main disk of \flower, with $\alpha_{\rm vir}\approx$\,2.
Differences in their $\alpha_{\rm vir}$ most likely result from the weaker stellar feedback in the satellite galaxies as they have experienced less episodes of \SF compared to \flower (i.e., lower stellar-to-gas mass ratios of $\sim$0.1).

% pext
As shown in \Fig{larsons_single},
MCs in the main disk of \flower have higher pressure than the sub-MCs. The lower virial parameter and external pressure of the sub-MCs compared to their parent MCs are consistent with the notion that collapsing structures result from local gravitational instability within globally non-collapsing structures \citep[see e.g.,][]{Ballesteros-Paredes11a}, which are supported by turbulence and rotation on large scales.
%Based on the virial parameter, velocity dispersion, and pressure of the MC identified in the main disk of \flower,
%the MC itself is gravitationally unbound and supported by turbulence (from the feedback of multiple episodes of \SF)
%and galactic rotation on large scales.
%% Turbulence in these substructures further dissipates in % e.g., shocks on even smaller scales, allowing sub-MCs to be bound and collapse.

For MCs in the satellite galaxies, we find even lower pressures and virial parameters, which are comparable to those found in clouds formed in the galactic disks  ($\alpha_{\rm vir}$\eq0.2$-$10; \citealt{Dobbs08a, Tasker09a}).
This suggests that MCs identified in the satellite galaxies are likely to be collapsing structures, and thus,\AP{i suspect a low or null \SF in the satellites, i.e. some of them should have $f_gas = 1$, i.e. no stars} \SF is expected to continue as gas from satellite galaxies is being accreted onto the main galaxies during the EoR.

 \DL{should probably move to somwehere later in this sec}
Maps of the Toomre $Q$ parameters for the gas, stars, and the effective two-component $Q_{\rm eff}$ are shown in \Fig{Qeff}
(see also \Fig{h2density} for example of MCs identified in this evolutionary stage of \flower
using different $n_{\rm cut}$). Fragmentation are expected in regions of low Toomre $Q$ values.
Close resemblance of the $Q_{\star}$ and $Q_{\rm eff}$ maps (especially in the central region of \flower)
indicates that contributions from the stellar component play an important role in
governing the stability of the MCs against $m$\eq0 perturbations.
This can be understood since stars in \flower dominates the central part of the galaxy in mass,
so their gravitational potential provides a non-negligible contribution to the instability.
Similarly, contribution from the thickness of the disk is important in \flower since its disk is not thin (with a
scale height to radius ratio of $h/r_{\rm gal}$\ssim150\,pc/1\,kpc\,$\simeq$\,0.15) and since \flower is more of a warped disk. That is, some MCs are found in regions of $Q_{\rm gas}$\ssim1, 
which would suggest that they are gravitationally unstable;
however, when including the effects due to its stellar potential and the
thickness of its disk (via $\sigma_z$), some of these MCs are consistent with $Q_{\rm eff} > 1$.
This highlights the importance of accounting for stellar contribution and disk thickness 
when examining the stability of
molecular gas structures, especially in the relatively evolved and enriched systems at high redshifts
that are preferentially being imaged at high resolution with ALMA. 
One should be caution when interpreting results based on gas-only Toomre $Q$ analysis.
In the outer regions of \flower, on the other hand, $Q_{\rm eff}$ resembles $Q_{\rm gas}$, with 
both $\log{Q_{\rm gas}}$ and $\log{Q_{\rm eff}} < -1$. 
Notably, these are the more gas-rich regions (see \Fig{sigma}).

\end{figure*}


The apparently large virial parameters seen in the MCs of \flower can be understood using the Toomre $Q$ parameter (see \Fig{Qeff}). We first note that fragmentation {\it can} happen in regions of low $Q$ (if we only consider instability against axisymmetric perturbations), but further evolution/collapse depends on the dynamics or equation of state of the gas.
%
Such fragmentation is expected to take place at the critical scale length $\lambda_{\rm crit} < 2 \pi^2 G \Sigma / \kappa^2$. Second, this fragmentation scale is greater than the typical size of GMCs. This could be interpreted as a result of instability setting the scales for fragmentation, but the star-forming GMCs correspond to the collapsing, denser, and cooler molecular structures that are on smaller scales.
%
Thus, the high virial parameter found for most MCs in \flower, which is the ratio between the velocity dispersion (accounts for effect of pressure and rotation) and surface density, indicate that most of them are not collapsing structures. As such, \AP{some or most?}
\DL{I think we can keep "some"?}
some MCs are found to lie in regions of $Q_{\rm eff}>1$.
% some MCs at Q < 1, some are marginally stable against m=0 mode perturb, some are Q>1.
Only in (the denser) regions with a low Toomre $Q_{\rm eff}$ parameter and when energy can be dissipated on a timescale that is shorter than the timescale over which it gains energy (e.g., heating) correspond to star-forming {\it clumps} and {\it cores} with low virial parameters.
%
This would also (at least partially) explain the seemingly inconsistency between the high $\alpha_{\rm vir}$ nature of most MCs of \flower and its relatively \AP{however, the high sfr is in some of the clumps, which does not necessarily correspond to the location of current H2 rich clumps}
\DL{don't understand this comment}
high SFR. That is, if most of the molecular gas in \flower are stable against collapse, how does it sustain its high SFR of $\sim$70\,\Msun\,yr\pmOne in the starburst phase?
%
\AP{however, such high-sfr is only seen in case (b), while high alpha vir are seen in all cases; i do not fully see the discrepancy}
\DL{maybe it's just we should also account for stellar mass in alpha vir, but leave it out when we compare that with observations?}
The discrepancy can be explained in two ways. First, our results are limited by the resolution of the simulation, such that, in each MC, there likely exist multiple smaller-scales molecular structures (e.g., clumps and cores),
as in the classical molecular cloud hierarchy. This re-iterates the statement about low $Q$ above.
%
Second, due to turbulence dissipation on small-scales, such (sub-)structures are no longer supported by large-scale gravitational potential and differential rotation. This in turn enables subregions of the MCs to collapse and potentially form OB associations out of these unbound MCs \citep{Clark04a, Clark05a}.
%
Additionally, mechanisms causing non-axisymmetric perturbations (e.g., arms) to the gravitational potential can induce orbit crossing, shocks and dissipation in gas, promoting turbulence dissipation and collapse on smaller scales to trigger \SF.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}      \label{sec:conclusion}

We study the dynamical properties of molecular clouds complexes and their temporal evolution in a \z$\sim$\,6 prototypical galaxy
at the EoR using state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulation (\ncode{Serra}),
which includes a chemical network to determine the formation of molecular
hydrogen, heating and cooling of the ISM by metals, and stellar feedback.
We use a clump-finding algorithm and a set of H$_2$ volumetric densities
to identify MCs and their sub-structures in the main galaxy of the
simulated 20\,Mpc~$h$\pmOne box --- \flower\ --- and in its satellites.
We decompose the molecular structures into non-overlapping tiles
by identifying a set of different density contours at different evolutionary stages.
Using volumetric H$_2$ is essentially similar to identifying molecular structures using
different contour levels/surfaces on surface brightness maps/cubes of molecular line tracers (e.g., CO, CS, NH$_3$),
since the line luminosity scales with the molecular gas density (modulo optical depth effects).
We extract properties such as mass, size, Mach number, velocity dispersion, gas surface density, and virial parameter for each MC and
compare them with those observed in the Milky Way disk, the Galactic center,
and gas-rich starburst galaxies in the local Universe and at the peak epoch of cosmic \SF.
We also examine their properties at the different evolutionary stages of \flower and compare
them with observations.

We find that the MC of \flower are highly supersonic, with high velocity dispersions ($\sigma\approx$\,200\,\kms) comparable to
those observed in $z$\ssim2 starburst galaxies.
The mass scale of the MCs is of the order of $10^{6.5-9}$\,\Msun. The $\sim$200\,pc-scale MCs found with a low density threshold
correspond to the arms of the disk of \flower which break down into smaller $\lesssim$100\,pc-scale MCs at higher density thresholds.
The more massive and bigger MCs in \flower compared to the Milky Way
likely result from the higher gas mass fraction, surface density, and velocity dispersion,
which set the scale for fragmentation.
This physical scale is
consistent with what has been found in higher resolution idealized simulation of isolated galaxies.
Our simulation here confirms these results at EoR and under
the influence of continuous gas accretion from the surrounding IGM (see e.g., \citealt{Klessen10a, Goldbaum11a}).

We compare the dynamics of MCs in \flower to \obs in the context of the Larson's relation.
The MCs of \flower are found to have higher $\sigma$ and $\Sigma$ systematically regardless of the
density threshold $n_{\rm cut}$ adopted in identifying the structures.
Our results are thus insensitive to the various density cuts of choice.
The velocity dispersion remains $\gtrsim$100\,\kms even when we increase the
density threshold and even for the molecular substructures.
Such a high velocity dispersion likely results from
the strong supernova and stellar feedback \flower experienced over the multiple episodes of bursty \SF.

Virial analysis indicates that MC/arms of the main disk of \flower are unbound, but substructures have
lower virial parameter. Some of these sub-MCs have Toomre $Q_{\rm eff}$ parameters consistent with being
gravitationally unstable. This is consistent with the notion that collapsing structures resulting from
gravitational instability occur within globally stable structures, which are
supported by turbulence and rotation on large scale.
We also find $\alpha_{\rm vir}\approx$\,2 for MCs in the satellite galaxies, which we interpret as
result of the weaker stellar feedback compared to \flower.
MCs in the satellites are therefore likely collapsing structures.

In terms of the scaling relations examined, we do not observe any significant
temporal variations in the MC dynamics over the course of 700\,Myr traced in our simulation.
Similarly, we do not find any significant dependence on the H$_2$ volume density threshold adopted
in the scaling relations examined (see Appendix \Sec{ncut}).
Our results are thus robust against the density threshold adopted.

Determining the multi-phase ISM properties of early galaxies
is a critical piece to understanding the evolution and
assembly history of galaxies, since they set the pace
for chemical reactions and excitation rates for the coolants in the ISM (and subsequent star formation).
Observations leveraging the combination of spatial-spectral imaging of
multi-band continuum and spectral line emission are crucial for better understanding
the role of \highz galaxy populations
in the context of galaxy evolution and the ISM physics behind their intense star formation in the early Universe.
Cosmological zoom-in simulations, such as \ncode{Serra}, while inherently limited in galaxy
statistics and is subject to the sub-grid models adopted,
serve as an useful avenue/tool for examining and making predictions on the morphology and dynamics of
the molecular ISM of the first galaxies.
%Future higher resolution zoom-in simulations would certainly be useful to understand
%the evolving dynamical properties of the lower-mass molecular structures in
%galaxies at EoR under the influence of gas inflow/outflow (i.e., accounting for energy injection at large scale due to infall/outflow).
These predictions can in turn be
tested with high resolution imaging of the gas content in the first galaxies with telescopes such as ALMA and the ngVLA, thereby
enabling us to test our findings and refine future simulations to shed light on the physical processes behind
\SF since the cosmic dark ages.

\section{Variation in MC Properties Depending on the Choice of Density Cuts and Temporal Evolution in Cloud Dynamics}    \label{sec:ncut}
% single Snapshot
We investigate possible variations in the dynamics of the molecular structures of \flower and its satellites to test the robustness of our results against the choice of density threshold by adopting
different sets of $n_{\rm cut}$ in identifying the MCs.
That is, how sensitive are the structure properties, and thus, the results presented in \Sec{singless} dependent on the choice of density thresholds. We vary the choice of H$_2$ density for each of the evolutionary stages and find no obvious differences in our results (i.e., inferences on the dynamics of \z$\sim$\,6 MCs in relation to those observed in nearby and \z$\sim$2 galaxies in the context of
cloud scaling relations).
%
In addition, for the densest MC in the main disk of \flower, we find that while its size decreases as we increase $n_{\rm cut}$ --- as one would intuitively expect, the velocity dispersion remain approximately $\sigma\simeq$\,200\,\kms (see also \Fig{larsons_single}).
%
This lack of variation is reassuring, in the sense that at least on the scales studied here, the dynamics of the MCs are not artifacts or biased by our choice of $n_{\rm cut}$. Our results are therefore robust to the various density cuts of choice.

% temporal evolution in Cloud Dynamics
We show the properties of all MCs identified across all evolutionary stages in \Fig{larsons16-28} and \Fig{alpha16-28}. We find no quantitative differences in the cloud properties over the 700\,Myr traced in our simulation.
