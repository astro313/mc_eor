- need to think about how to flatten all the AMR hydro (levels) onto one, and then in a form that we can parse through clustering algorithms.
- take out the idea of using disperse after talking to M. Mac Low
- Maybe attempt with clumpfind (3D version) but be aware of the caveats
- read paper by Juan C. Ibáñez-Mejía about multiple clodus in potential wells (also careful about the filaments).

- science:
  - after ID-ing MCs, compare against obs. in nearby Dor 30? W49? 
  - note, we may care about using H2 as criterion at early times since it's needed to cool down to dense enough regions for SF, but soon as the first gen. of stars form, there are other species that can do the cooling, so H2 should not be used as the only defining criterion for SF. 
    - to confirm, why don't we do the ID using 1) H2 and 2) Pressure,density from the AMR output and compare the two?!
