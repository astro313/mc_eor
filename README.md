See github commit and code doc for other progres.. lazy to update this README file.

July 6th 2018
- even after identifying clumps/blobs, how can we tell if they are self-gravitating structure?

July 5th 2018
- see progress in code documentation and github commit.

July 4th 2018
- see progress in code documentation and github commit.

July 3rd 2018
- continued from plotting contours over H2 density map..

July 2nd 2018
- need to think about how to flatten all the AMR hydro (levels) onto one, and then in a form that we can parse through clustering algorithms.
- take out the idea of using disperse after talking to M. Mac Low
- Maybe attempt with clumpfind (3D version) but be aware of the caveats
- read paper by Juan C. Ibáñez-Mejía about multiple clodus in potential wells (also careful about the filaments).
- note overlapping regions.

- science - investigate the dynamical properties of molecular cloud complexes at EoR in simulations.
  - look at molecular cloud complexes in models and their evolution (across diff. snapshots)
  - physical properties of interests: 
      + e.g., gas surface density, SK relation of the identified cloud complexes
      + velocity dispersion of clouds, size, SD
      + (thermal and non-thermal) pressure
      + etc
  - after ID-ing MCs, compare against obs. in nearby Dor 30? W49? 
  - note, we may care about using H2 as criterion at early times since it's needed to cool down to dense enough regions for SF, but soon as the first gen. of stars form, there are other species that can do the cooling, so H2 should not be used as the only defining criterion for SF. 
    - to confirm, why don't we do the ID using 1) H2 and 2) Pressure,density from the AMR output and compare the two?!
